Suas mãos nesse carinho, em denguidacho são como cura humanizada, antiga reza pois o lugar em que me encontro é onde me acho e teu afago leva embora o que me pesa no seu colo deposito meu cansaço é a sensação do banho quente em dia frio sinto essas mãos entre o conforto e o arrepio e na cadência do carinho eu me refaço.

Executive directors are the CEOs of nonprofit organizations. They run the day-to-day business, manage employees, and are responsible for income and expenses and keeping within budgets. If the nonprofit has a location, the ED is typically on location. The executive director reports to the board of directors. The board should plan to review the ED annually, establish goals, and determine whether or not those goals are being met.

Takers have a distinctive signature: they like to get more than they give. They tilt reciprocity in their own favor, putting their own interests ahead of others’ needs. Takers believe that the world is a competitive, dog-eat-dog place. They feel that to succeed, they need to be better than others. To prove their competence, they self-promote and make sure they get plenty of credit for their efforts. Garden-variety takers aren’t cruel or cutthroat; they’re just cautious and self-protective. “If I don’t look out for myself first,” takers think, “no one will.”

In the workplace, givers are a relatively rare breed. They tilt reciprocity in the other direction, preferring to give more than they get. Whereas takers tend to be self-focused, evaluating what other people can offer them, givers are other-focused, paying more attention to what other people need from them. These preferences aren’t about money: givers and takers aren’t distinguished by how much they donate to charity or the compensation that they command from their employers. Rather, givers and takers differ in their attitudes and actions toward other people.

in the workplace, give and take becomes more complicated. Professionally, few of us act purely like givers or takers, adopting a third style instead. We become matchers, striving to preserve an equal balance of giving and getting. Matchers operate on the principle of fairness: when they help others, they protect themselves by seeking reciprocity. If you’re a matcher, you believe in tit for tat, and your relationships are governed by even exchanges of favors.

When takers win, there’s usually someone else who loses. Research shows that people tend to envy successful takers and look for ways to knock them down a notch. In contrast, when givers like David Hornik win, people are rooting for them and supporting them, rather than gunning for them. Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success of people around them.

To illustrate, imagine that you’re assigned to a group of four. The other three people are strangers, and you’ll each make anonymous decisions, with no opportunity to communicate, during six rounds. In each round, each of you will receive $3 and decide whether to take it for yourselves or give it to the group. If you take it, you get the full $3. If you give it to the group, every group member gets $2, including you. At the end of each round, you’ll find out what everyone decided. The group is better off if everyone gives—each member would end up receiving $8 per round, for a maximum total over six rounds of $48. But if you give and no one else does, you only get $12. This creates an incentive to take, which will guarantee you $18.

The goal of the group is to instill the value of giving: you don’t have to be transactional about it, you don’t have to trade it. If you do something for somebody in the group, then when you need it, someone in the group will do something for you.”

When Huckman and Pisano examined the data, they discovered a remarkable pattern. Overall, the surgeons didn’t get better with practice. They only got better at the specific hospital where they practiced. For every procedure they handled at a given hospital, the risk of patient mortality dropped by 1 percent. But the risk of mortality stayed the same at other hospitals. The surgeons couldn’t take their performance with them. They weren’t getting better at performing coronary artery bypass grafts. They were becoming more familiar with particular nurses and anesthesiologists, learning about their strengths and weaknesses, habits, and styles. This familiarity helped them avoid patient deaths, but it didn’t carry over to other hospitals. To reduce the risk of patient mortality, the surgeons needed relationships with specific surgical team members.

FAST MINDS Traits May Have Posed an Evolutionary Advantage Evolution, the theory goes, preserves traits that serve a purpose. Studies from large populations suggest that the signs of ADHD are common across the population, occurring at varying levels on a continuum—meaning that there is a chance of having few, some, or many traits, with individuals with ADHD falling at one extreme.6 It has been proposed that these ADHD traits survive in the general population because they presented an evolutionary advantage. The theory goes that our ancient ancestors would have benefited from having group members with heightened awareness of their surroundings, an ability to quickly respond to threats or prey, an extreme level of energy to sustain long-distance travel, and an extra edge during the hunt or combat.7 Just as changing human contexts over the ages may have shifted which traits are most useful, people today with FAST MINDS traits may fit better in roles where their attributes are valued

There are two major schools of thought about how to address self-esteem problems. One says that people should stop beating up on themselves—once the self-blame stops, they will feel better. The other says that people need to be effective to feel effective. We embrace both.

Differences in the function of the prefrontal cortex appear to contribute to ADHD.Brain-imaging studies have shown that the prefrontal region is a key part of the circuit that governs our ability to engage in tasks. In some people with ADHD, this circuit may be less active during organization and attention tasks than it is in those without the condition

RECOGNIZING YOURSELF Imagine that you are in an everyday situation, such as a classroom, conversation, or job: Do you often get sidetracked while doing tasks? Does your mind feel busy or clouded? Do you find that thoughts and ideas pop up and leave you daydreaming or distracted? Do you keep thinking about other things you need to do? Does sound and activity around you make it hard to work or converse?

INTERNAL DISTRACTIONS PHYSICAL DISTRACTIONS: The brain’s control center doesn’t function well if someone is unhealthy, poorly nourished, or tired—making it hard to concentrate and learn. Illness, pain, or lack of sleep can all undermine brain performance. EMOTIONAL DISTRACTIONS: Excitement or dread can be distracting —think of the night before a big trip, a performance, meeting future in-laws for the first time, or starting a new job. Everyone has many different states of mind, even in the course of one day, some of which are counterproductive to doing effortful mental work. The intensity and changes in emotion are themselves a kind of internal distraction, as thoughts shift with feelings. PACE: Some people with FAST MINDS also seem to have an internal restlessness—like a metronome constantly ticking—that keeps them needing a fast pace or moving on from one thing to the next. Others talk about constantly being distracted by their own ideas; before they’ve had a chance to complete one thought, another one pops into their head and they drop the first to pursue the second.

STRESS: Stress is a common form of internal distraction. Some people seem to focus better under pressure, which awakens the behavioral control parts of the brain.6 One man we know struggled with graduate school yet thrived in a job in a war zone. Many others can’t finish projects without the pressure of a looming deadline. “It is as if I will fill all available time with who-knows-what before something is due, and then pull it off at the last minute,” a college student told us, sounding a lot like Eddie from Chapter 2. Stress, then, can be productive in the short-term and in moderate amounts

This same hyperawareness of surroundings can also be an advantage at least some of the time. People with ADHD may notice more of what is going on around them, from things they see in passing on the street to what a co-worker is working on. A salesperson may make a connection with a client by noticing the kinds of photos on their wall; a parent may find a teachable moment when passing a construction site. This heads-up way of going through the world can make someone a great explorer, and in some people it seems to contribute to a broad knowledge of their environments and the world

MANAGING A MESSY WORK AREA 1. Select one area of your workspace (e.g., half of your desk, your tool bench). 2. Estimate how much time it will take to organize that single area and set aside the necessary time. 3. Make sure you have trash and recycle bins handy. 4.

Place any items requiring storage in storage immediately, instead of moving them to another area of the workspace. 6. Place everyday items within easy reach and vision. 7. Once the job is completed, give yourself a reward. 8. Plan to tackle another small area of your workspace the following day at the same time (break it down in chunks: e.g., from 10:00 to 10:15 I will clean an area of my workspace). 9. Leave yourself a reminder (computer, smart phone) to do this task on a daily basis until your work area is organized

Scheduling action items from your thought-capture record and to-do lists—for example, to get ready to return to college or graduate school, you could distribute tasks in blocks of times over the next few weekend afternoons, such as researching housing options, checking what credits you need to graduate, choosing courses, and arranging travel. Revising time estimates—if you have done a task many times, you may have a good idea of how long it will take—but sometimes estimates will be wrong. How long it will take to reorganize a closet may need radical adjustment if it now includes sorting and discarding items that have fallen in the back where you forgot them. Breaking down action items into steps you can do in a reasonable space of time and focus on. Remember that it is easier to engage in something that can be easily held in mind. So if you are trying to explore job options, consider steps such as “write down what I like to do and what I do well,” “make a list of positions in fields that would match those traits,” “make a list of resources I can use to find a job—contacts, credentials, references,” “pick some positions to apply for.” Planning well for things means that you avoid overloading yourself. If there isn’t time to do it, something else has to give. Use your planning times to decide which to-do items are priorities, and set aside enough time to accomplish them. Some people like to schedule out each day hour by hour. However, many people with FAST MINDS find they are more productive if they allow themselves periods of flexible time where they can choose among their to-do list priorities. They might write “tackle at-home to-do list” in their planner for Saturday afternoon, and then choose among the priorities on that list when Saturday comes.

Do you often feel overwhelmed or like you are “flying by the seat of your pants”? Do you have to be rigid in your habits to keep your life from spinning out of control? Do you live among so many piles and so much clutter that it’s hard to find things you need or it embarrasses you? If you have lots to do, is it hard to know where to start first? Do you get bogged down in tasks that someone else could do for you? Do you realize well into the day that you are off track from what you intended to do?

Storing factual information for later retrieval requires establishing the information in working memory—but using that information or associating it with other information appears to help the storage process.

Organization is a constant process. It is not something that is ever “solved” but requires constant effort. No one can ever “master” the dishes, the laundry or the mail—they always pile up again regardless of how well you handled them the last time. Don’t waste physical, emotional, and mental time trying to be perfectly organized—or beating up on yourself for not being Martha Stewart (who has an army of people doing her shopping, cooking, cleaning, and organizing). Instead, spend your time and energy creating good systems that require minimal steps and keep you ahead of crises. We also appreciate that people with FAST MINDS traits may need to regularly reinvent their systems to keep each one interesting

A critical moment is the moment before you might make a bad choice. It could be a thought like “This is too much for me,” so you end up not doing what you should. It could be when you do the next thing you think of instead of checking your planner. It could be dropping the mail in a pile instead of paying a bill then and there. Critical moments are like a fork in the road, one way leading to a life that runs well, and the other to disorganization. Executive function challenges make it harder to see the organized path and to follow it even if it is visible. Just how hard it is to engage these principled, organized behaviors depends on a person’s strengths

Your schedule can serve as a peripheral brain if you use it to prioritize, allocate your time for planning purposes, and add a reminder system. Some people set an alarm on their computer or phone a few times a day to check whether they are sticking with their daily plans. Use an alarm ten minutes before you have to leave for an event, or at night to remind you to shut off electronics and get ready for bed—so you don’t stay up until two A.M. and fall apart exhausted the next day. Some people like to set an alarm on their electronic calendar to remind them of a recurring obligation—such as paying monthly bills or picking the kids up at school

CHECKLIST FOR EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE HABITS Think about an area of your life that you care about but is not going well because of lack of organization. Run through these questions to see if you have the necessary habits to organize yourself: 1. Am I holding a clear vision of what I need to do in my mind? Do I have the steps broken down enough to “see” each one; are they written out, drawn out, talked through? 2. Can I get information off my mind but accessible? (Write them on a list, or allocate tasks on a planner.) 3. Is there a function that I can outsource? (Such as automated alarms for reminders, meetingplanning websites, smart recording pens…) 4. Am I blocking out time each day for the priorities I need to accomplish? 5. Do I have the right physical place—with the fewest alternate activities or least environmental noise—to get it done? 6. Am I doing things at the best time? (Think of when you will have the energy and the tools you need.) 7. What is going to really happen if I try this the way I am thinking? What problems might get in my way?

If you know what your challenges are, you can fake yourself out: Avert problems by anticipating them. Leaving things by the door for work can ensure that you will trip over them even if you don’t remember them. If you’re always losing your keys, make a few extra sets. If you are timechallenged, consider doubling your estimate of how long it will take you to get somewhere or complete a task. If you think the job will take you ten hours, leave yourself twenty; if you’re certain the drive across town won’t take you more than fifteen minutes, leave at least thirty. We know people who set their watch ahead a vague amount of time, or have two alarm clocks in their bedroom with different times—and intentionally fail to keep track of which is accurate.

some people have less natural capacity than others. It is possible to use the conscious mind to compensate for such an innate shortfall, but the bigger the gap between will and impulse, the harder it is to compensate. So people who naturally struggle to control impulsivity find it harder to use self-control to override impulsive instincts

Our brains are wired with “mental brakes”—which create what researchers call response inhibition, referring to the capacity to suppress immediate reactions and allow a choice among alternative reactions. This ability improves with age and development. The brain regions thought to be involved in impulsive physical behavior include the following:1 the prefrontal cortex, which is believed to play a role in monitoring behavior and consequences the basal ganglia, an area involved in planned motor movement and rich in the neurotransmitter transporters that stimulants attach to the subthalamic nuclei, which may stop a premature response when there are multiple possible responses, thus allowing for better decision making

We find that there are three major kinds of impulsive critical moments: Emotional decision making: Strong moods can distort anyone’s ability to make decisions. Nearsighted thinking: Focusing on the immediate leads to an unplanned life.

If you have a predictable or avoidable critical moment of impulsivity, think whether the following habits will help you pause and make more engaged choices: Avoid the trigger! If possible make barriers between you and whatever is your downfall. For instance, don’t keep all your snacks in the kitchen; keep some farther away, such as in the basement; or avoid buying junk food altogether. Don’t use wireless at home; plug in only for Internet service, so it’s slower and harder to get online, giving you time to question whether you really should be surfing so late at night. Delay the choice until a better time when you can effectively engage your prefrontal cortex

Is it hard to stick with resolutions and organizational strategies? Is it hard for you to delegate tasks to others? Does your work lack meaning? Do you spend time doing pleasurable things when you should be getting work done? Do you come up with new ideas, projects, and hobbies instead of developing skills or mastering old ones? Do you “go it alone” instead of asking for help?

Imagine you are in a CNN interview. Speak in sound bites: two to three sentences and stop. Try listening more than talking—make a game out of it, if that helps. Before speaking, check whether what you are about to say is truly a reply to their last comment or to a tangential idea. Write down what you want to say to make it more concrete. Match their level of emotional and personal content. Set a mutual agenda for the conversation from the outset. MANAGING EMOTIONAL COMMUNICATION

Personalidades narcisistas costumam se sustentar através da manipulação emocional dos outros, principalmente de vítimas empáticas que assumem facilmente o papel de cuidar e proteger o abusador. Narcisistas camuflados (os chamados covert narcisists) são mais difíceis de identificar pois esse tipo cria uma ilusão que muitas vezes sugere aos outros que é o oposto daquilo que é, ao contrário dos narcisistas cujos egos inflados são facilmente reconhecíveis (os overt narcisists). Os deliberadamente narcisistas (overt) podem ser desagradáveis e até perigosos, mas são assumidamente vaidosos e cheios de si. Os camuflados (covert) se apropriam de características de suas vítimas e se passam por pessoas capazes de querer o bem alheio (querem ser lidas como boas, mas sempre um pouco melhor e superior ao resto da humanidade, nunca é uma bondade desinteressada). Podem não dizer isso abertamente, mas se repararmos bem, veremos que qualquer um desses tipos de narcisistas desqualificam os outros constantemente (não conseguem evitar), mesmo usando uma mascara graciosa ou justificativas aparentemente nobres quando são socialmente mais sofisticados. Uma das chaves está em reconhecer o que fazem, e não apenas toma-los pelo que falam.

A grandiosidade pode se manifestar de diversas maneiras em narcisistas de tipos diferentes, por exemplo: nas características elitista (se sentem superior quando tem mais dinheiro do que outros) ou no destaque intelectual (críticos, professores que precisam ter a ultima palavra e ser considerados brilhantes) ou habilidade social (personalidades públicas, pessoas de mil amigos superficiais) ou, ainda, em gurus espirituais (criam uma persona de superioridade, elevação espiritual, para poder julgar os demais). Seja lá qual for o modo como o narcisista se valida, ele precisa ganhar mais crédito do que todos os outros no recinto naquilo que lhe tem valor, naquilo que o propicia poder. Sem nenhum mérito concreto, apenas por se projetar como “merecedor nato

Mesmo que o motivo nunca seja explícito, o narcisista achará um modo de desviar a atenção dessa alegria alheia para um problema, ou uma crítica ou uma outra ocupação. Um empático mais sensível, mesmo que não consciente da doença do narcisista, pode sentir que não merece essa felicidade, ou que não é bom o suficiente quando alfinetado, ou que deve diminuir o usufruto de sua alegria diante de um problema que surge do nada (arquitetado pelo narcisista), ou ainda, sentir que há um perigo meio inexplicável em estar bem e então se diminui para não ferir o ego do outro com sua própria felicidade.

Em abusos intensos e bem-sucedidos, os parceiros empáticos são tão apagados e silenciados na relação, que acabam ocultando suas paixões; porém, as mesmas aparecerão nas falas do narcisista como se fossem deles. Fica entendido que, na ilusão fabricada para a autoimagem do narcisista, só o narcisista pode brilhar. Seus parceiros, quando se colocam de forma mais autêntica, só podem estar imitando esses “gênios” na visão de pessoas mais distantes.

[Adoração] - É a fase da conquista e da idealização. Essa é a etapa inicial quando o narcisista acaba de conhecer sua vítima em potencial. O narcisista tratará a vítima especialmente bem, e ela, como empática, responde a isso de forma aberta enquanto sua empatia é projetada de volta pelo narcisista (essa técnica de manipulação é conhecida como “espelhamento”). Cria-se uma relação especial, que envolve atenção, demonstração de afeto, muitas vezes presentes e comunicação bastante frequente, a relação nesse estágio parece promissora e até “boa demais para ser verdade”.

[Descarte] - Não importa o que a vítima fizer, o narcisista irá descartá-la, jogá-la fora eventualmente, mesmo que apenas como teste (pois, na maioria das vezes não tem a intenção real de se livrar da vítima, é apenas uma estratégia do jogo doentio).

[O “tempo” misterioso ou preocupante] - Esse espaço é arquitetado para deixar a porta aberta. Pode até vir com uma solicitação “eu preciso de um tempo”, por motivos não claros para a vítima, mas que costuma insinuar que há algo de errado, uma depressão ou algo não dito que parece grave, preocupante.

importante é entender que o ciclo de abuso emocional funciona não só porque uma das partes é narcisista, mas sim porque uma é narcisista e a outra empática e permissiva.

Sem a pessoa empática e permissiva, o narcisista não tem como atuar. A vítima tem um poder enorme para interromper o ciclo, mas não percebe isso quando está dentro da relação e reproduzindo a mentalidade do empático permissivo: tentando agradar, com medo de confronto, duvidando de si mesma, assumindo culpas que não são suas, permitindo que lhe tratem mal, etc.

Uma das marcas do abuso narcisista camuflado é a dúvida. Como a vítima desse tipo de abuso vai de um polo ao outro (do ser adorada ao ser rejeitada) de modo efetivo, ela vislumbra que o abusador pode ser o que ele aparenta ser nas fases boas e tenta se convencer de que os ferimentos injustificáveis podem ser justificados.

Ninguém tem o afeto de um narcisista, isso é uma ilusão. O que importa para eles nas relações afetivas é a função que o outro cumpre ao supri-los com material empático. Por isso a enorme facilidade que tem em substituir uma vítima por outras vítimas quando a fonte principal seca ou vai embora.

É possível ver o sofrimento do outro, inclusive o do narcisista, mas não se deixar enganar, escolhendo não ser um viabilizador da doença alheia. Permitir o abuso às custas da própria felicidade e do auto respeito não cura o sofrimento de ninguém e só fortalece o abusador em seu aspecto mais nocivo. Aprender a tornar o abuso menos possível pode ser uma tarefa sem fim,

Frustrar o outro de vez em quando também não é um crime, faz parte da vida e de qualquer dinâmica saudável. Talvez exatamente pelo convívio com narcisistas, o empático tenha aprendido desde cedo que deve evitar decepcionar os outros a qualquer custo, o que gera uma pressão irreal e desnecessária sobre si.

Saber pedir o que se quer é um outro lado da moeda dessa mesma questão. O exercício de afirmação das próprias necessidades e vontade pode ser difícil para o empático, mas sem aprender a desenvolver isso ele terá poucas chances de criar simetrias em suas relações interpessoais

Um ambiente em que as pessoas são abertas umas com as outras não existe na presença de um narcisista. Eles envenenam as relações, invariavelmente. Criam um ambiente caótico, muitas vezes hiper controlados, onde todos se ressentem, e, idealmente, de forma velada de modo que conversar e resolver questões emocionais fique mais difícil. Os ódios quando velados e criados por meio de fofocas disparadas pelos narcisistas, podem fazer uma pessoa se sentir alfinetada por outra sem que ele fique em evidência como causador.

é, muitas vezes, impossível fazer o diagnóstico etiológico em uma única entrevista. Deve-se admitir, então, que, num primeiro tempo, na prática, a atitude racional consiste em estabelecer uma aliança com o paciente sobre um primeiro trabalho a realizar: médico e paciente devem procurar compreender juntos como sucederam os acontecimentos e, especialmente, como os esforços do paciente para resistir à descompensação foram insuficientes

O papel da relação com o trabalho nas doenças mentais, tanto quanto na construção da saúde, é muito mais importante do que se admite geralmente. Em outras palavras, a relação com o trabalho está sempre presente, tanto na construção da saúde mental quanto na gênese da doença. Ou, para dizê-lo de outra maneira ainda, a relação com o trabalho nunca é neutra no que se refere à saúde mental. Porque, se o trabalho pode gerar o pior, como nos casos apresentados neste livro, ele também pode gerar o melhor. Graças ao trabalho, muitos seres humanos têm a oportunidade de desenvolver sua identidade e fortalecer sua saúde mental. Inversamente, aqueles que são privados de trabalho por causa do desemprego são privados do direito de dar uma contribuição à empresa, à sociedade, até mesmo à cultura

Para resistir ao sofrimento gerado pelos constrangimentos do trabalho pode ser necessário desenvolver defesas sutis e sólidas, mas tais defesas comprometem toda a personalidade. Por isso, têm grandes reflexos nas condutas e atitudes na esfera privada, até mesmo na economia dos corpos e nas relações amorosas. Se levarmos em conta, além disso, as relações de dominação que os homens exercem sobre as mulheres, isto é, de gênero, a intrincação entre trabalho e esfera privada torna-se ainda mais estreita e complicada, pois, ao trabalho na esfera da produção soma-se a questão da divisão do trabalho na esfera doméstica. E essa divisão na esfera privada nunca é independente da relação de cada homem e de cada mulher com o trabalho na esfera produtiva.

Agrade-nos ou não, precisamos admitir que as questões clínicas e teóricas levantadas pelo impacto dos constrangimentos da vida profissional sobre a saúde mental permanecem desconhecidas pelos psiquiatras. Todo mundo sabe, vagamente, que existe por aí uma corrente de pesquisa chamada de “psicopatologia do trabalho”. Mas são poucos os que sabem mais do que isso. Quantos ouviram falar de Louis Le Guillant? Quem se lembra do conteúdo dos trabalhos da Liga Francesa de Higiene Mental? Quem leu as pesquisas de Claude Veil sobre o trabalho? Quem conhece as teorizações de Adolfo Fernandez-Zoïla sobre a vivência do trabalho? Por outro lado, todos ouviram falar das pesquisas sobre o estresse no trabalho, o burn out. Mais pela mídia e pelas revistas semanais de informação do que pelas revistas científicas, mas, de resto, não há muito interesse porque essa corrente de pesquisa se desenvolve dentro de um marco behaviorista: ao alcance dos diretores de recursos humanos e outros gestores, certamente, mas um pouco sucinta e simplista demais para o profissional que se interessa pela discussão psicopatológica e etiológica

Para alguns pesquisadores em psicologia, antropologia, sociologia e economia, o trabalho ocupa um lugar central no funcionamento da sociedade, na produção das riquezas e nas economias nacionais, assim como no funcionamento psíquico e na construção da identidade. A “centralidade do trabalho” é a expressão empregada na comunidade científica para designar a tese que defendem esses pesquisadores (Jacques de Bandt et al., 1995).

O gosto pelas bebidas alcoólicas pode ser facilmente compreendido nesse contexto. Elas facilitam a sociabilidade e a convivência entre homens e, portanto, a coesão do coletivo. Sobretudo, o álcool possui uma poderosa ação ansiolítica que, além do mais, é perfeitamente dissimulada. O álcool é um substrato que apresenta todas as qualidades de um medicamento para garantir a virilidade e ajudar a combater o medo. Trata-se, portanto, de um sistema que associa: Uma reticência e uma desobediência à prevenção. Comportamentos perigosos de desafio aos riscos. Uma disciplina rigorosa em relação aos sinais externos de coragem. Proibições absolutas a qualquer alusão ao medo ou ao sofrimento. Um discurso que modula todos os comportamentos, atitudes e condutas em relação a uma escala virilidade/feminilidade

Na medicina, como na psiquiatria, a tendência é apreender a normalidade, ou mesmo a saúde, a partir de conceitos negativos: ausência de doença, silêncio dos órgãos, etc. Essa concepção é errônea. A saúde do corpo é o resultado da luta encarnada (permitam-me a metáfora) de regulagens fisiológicas contra as perturbações físico-químico-biológicas. É bem diferente de um estado passivo de ausência de doença caracterizado negativamente. A mesma coisa acontece, parece-me, com a saúde mental. Existem, neste caso também, “regulagens” muito sofisticadas que mobilizam dinâmicas intersubjetivas, não somente no campo afetivo (que a psicanálise conhece), mas também no campo das relações sociais e dos vínculos civis, que a psicanálise ignora e que são estudadas principalmente pela sociologia e pela antropologia da saúde, mas também pela psicodinâmica do trabalho

Mentalmente, de fato, para prodigar tal atenção à saúde de seus filhos, é preciso estar em condições de poder identificar-se com eles, com o sofrimento, as necessidades deles, etc. Identificar-se quer dizer ser capaz de se pôr no lugar deles. Porém, pôr-se no lugar deles não é muito compatível com a estratégia coletiva de defesa, que visa justamente a afastar toda e qualquer evocação da doença e do sofrimento do corpo.

totalmente artificial. Ao deixar o canteiro de obras, o sujeito continua sendo quem é, não pode mudar de pele nem de economia psíquica, de modo que o sofrimento no trabalho, convocando estratégias defensivas peculiares, corrompe toda a organização mental do sujeito e estende seus tentáculos até as relações com os filhos e o cônjuge. A economia do amor e a economia erótica são, de certa maneira, colonizadas pelas relações de trabalho. Se o espaço privado resistir, se não estiver em concordância com as exigências defensivas do trabalho, deve-se esperar uma descompensação. Desse exemplo, então, podemos reter que existe uma solidariedade psíquica fundamental entre vida de trabalho e vida extratrabalho, ou uma unidade econômica entre as duas modalidades da existência

Enquanto são jovens e solteiros, geralmente resistem bem aos riscos da profissão. Mas o casamento e, sobretudo, o nascimento dos filhos constituem uma das causas mais frequentes do que se denomina, nas forças armadas, “desadaptação à profissão de piloto de caça”. É preciso então remanejá-los como instrutores nas escolas de voo, como pilotos de helicóptero ou como pilotos no transporte aéreo militar, e mesmo dispensá-los, isto é, tirá-los das situações de risco, que eles antes suportavam bem ou até prezavam tanto. Encontramos exatamente as mesmas questões entre executivos e dirigentes. O problema é o mesmo com o senhor A. Sendo possível remanejá-lo para um trabalho sem os riscos habituais do setor da construção civil e de obras públicas, talvez ele melhore e fique curado.

saúde e doença não constituiriam um único e mesmo processo, nem mesmo seriam processos em continuidade, mas duas séries qualitativa e objetivamente diferentes, não se sobrepondo. Médicos e psiquiatras conhecem e descrevem a doença e a luta contra a doença. Sociólogos e antropólogos têm um conhecimento dos processos envolvidos na construção da saúde e no fracasso dessa construção. Assim, a descompensação (tanto quanto a normalidade, de resto) pode dar origem a duas descrições que não se sobrepõem. Existiria, portanto, um dualismo substancial saúde/doença, e não um continuum entre os dois tipos de processo; dualismo que seria reiterado pelo dualismo científico entre ciências médico-biológicas e ciências sociais a respeito das questões da saúde. De forma ideal, para poder dar conta exaustivamente de um estado psicossomático (normal ou patológico), duas descrições seriam necessárias: uma relativa ao estado dos processos mórbidos e a outra relativa ao estado dos processos da saúde

Acknowledging that for most of human history our ancestors were not as preoccupied with scarcity as we are now reminds us that there is far more to work than our efforts to solve the economic problem.

When economists define work as the time and effort we spend meeting our needs and wants, they dodge two obvious problems. The first is that often the only thing that differentiates work from leisure is context and whether we are being paid to do something or are paying to do it. To an ancient forager, hunting an elk is work, but to many First World hunters it is an exhilarating and often very expensive leisure activity; to a commercial artist, drawing is work, but to millions of amateur artists it is a relaxing pleasure; and to a lobbyist, cultivating relationships with movers and shakers is work, but for most of the rest of us making friends is a joy. The second problem is that beyond the energy we expend to secure our most basic needs—food, water, air, warmth, companionship, and safety—there is very little that is universal about what constitutes a necessity. More than this, necessity often merges so imperceptibly with desire that it can be impossible to separate them.

The closest thing to a universal definition of “work”—one that hunter-gatherers, pinstriped derivatives traders, calloused subsistence farmers, and anyone else would agree on—is that it involves purposefully expending energy or effort on a task to achieve a goal or end.

The first of these points of convergence comes when humans mastered fire possibly as long as a million years ago. In learning how to outsource some of their energy needs to flames, they acquired the gift of more time free from the food-quest, the means to stay warm in the cold, and the ability to vastly extend their diets, so fueling the growth of ever more energy-hungry, harder-working brains.

Cada forma de psicopatologia se mostrava compatível com uma política de sofrimento que, por exemplo, confirmava e replicava políticas específicas em termos de modos de subjetivação. Diante disso, é possível dizer que cada época prescreve a maneira como devemos exprimir ou esconder, narrar ou silenciar, reconhecer ou criticar modalidades específicas de sofrimento.

O mais difícil de suportar, no entanto, para Jeannine, é a perda de autonomia e a falta de reconhecimento num trabalho que passou a ser constantemente controlado por um chefe irritado, negando sua experiência e suas competências, intervindo o tempo todo para mandar interromper a atividade em andamento e realizar imediatamente outra tarefa considerada prioritária e que deve ser concluída antes de ser iniciada… O clima deteriorou-se entre os colegas. A ajuda mútua espontânea desapareceu, levada pelas ordens de reforço inesperadas, sempre vividas como uma sobrecarga de trabalho imposta desigualmente, quando, antes, “dar uma mão” depois de sua própria tarefa terminada não causava problema algum.

Seu desejo, inconscientemente, é a estima “social” da parte dos homens machistas, para poder, em seguida, estabelecer com eles uma relação erótica na alteridade entre os sexos, de igual para igual, não numa relação dominante/dominada. Esse conflito acaba mal do ponto de vista de sua busca de identidade sexual, porque a pregnância das relações sociais de dominação e a luta travada ali a conduzem constantemente a se portar como um homem, o que, então, não lhe possibilita mais fazer valer sua identidade de mulher

quando é fonte de sofrimento, a relação subjetiva com o trabalho é abordada conforme duas vias, entre as quais cada autor escolhe uma em função de seus pressupostos. Num caso, considera-se que a sociedade em geral é dotada de uma força gigantesca, incomparavelmente maior que aquela do desejo inconsciente, estabelecendo uma relação de forças semelhante àquela que existe entre um gigante malévolo e egoísta, de um lado, e uma criança indefesa e desprovida de recursos, de outro. Fala-se então simplesmente em termos de estresse ou de inibição comportamental[9], de adaptação ou de desadaptação[10]. Ou, noutro caso, considera-se que a sociedade é o que é, além de ser a mesma para todo mundo. Os transtornos psiconeuróticos, ainda que tomassem o palco da relação com o trabalho como terreno de expressão privilegiado, não questionariam a contingência do trabalho em sua etiologia. De fato, o impacto eventualmente deletério do trabalho não dependeria da sociedade, mas de fragilidades psiconeuróticas singulares, herdadas da neurose infantil.

Por fim, refletir sobre as questões práticas a partir da clínica feminina, pois, a meu ver, é nela que as dificuldades para a escuta são maiores.

As investigações realizadas na clínica e na psicopatologia do trabalho mostram que a adesão às estratégias coletivas de defesa tem um custo psíquico elevado. Na maior parte dos casos, essa adesão da qual depende a integração ao coletivo de trabalho passa não somente pelo consentimento passivo, mas também pela demonstração diante de todos os outros, cada vez que as circunstâncias exigem, de sua capacidade de trazer uma contribuição entusiasta e determinada ao funcionamento da dita estratégia viril. Quase todas as estratégias coletivas de defesa, no mundo do trabalho, foram construídas por homens e são perpassadas por um sistema de valores muito marcado pelos sinais externos da virilidade[16]. Para as mulheres, portanto, essas estratégias coletivas dos homens constituem um obstáculo à sua

progressão na hierarquia, pois quanto mais se sobe na escala das qualificações mais os cargos são tidos coletivamente como um espaço reservado aos homens. Dessa maneira, para terem uma chance de encontrar condições propícias ao reconhecimento das qualidades profissionais e à realização pessoal no trabalho, as mulheres devem seguidamente conformar-se com certas condutas ou integrar um habitus de homem. E para as mulheres, as provas, os trotes e outras formas de testes se tornam ainda mais frequentes e exigentes que para os homens.

no mundo do trabalho, a luta é árdua, a concorrência se torna cada vez mais temível, e ninguém dá nada a ninguém. Assim, para enfrentar o trabalho numa postura e num habitus viris, é necessário um completo engajamento nisso. A virilidade exibida só é socialmente eficaz no mundo do trabalho se não se restringir à superfície e se envolver toda a personalidade. Por isso, não é raro que para essas mulheres a ascensão social e profissional se traduza em perturbações nas relações com os homens, na desestabilização das relações conjugais, em divórcios ou separações

Paralelamente à riqueza clínica das pesquisas em saúde mental no trabalho, a noção de assédio (HIRIGOYEN, 1998) corre o risco de ocupar todo o horizonte conceitual, de maneira que as queixas dos trabalhadores tendem a ser enunciadas dessa única forma.

A noção de assédio induz a dupla “perverso/vítima” e poderia, ao remeter apenas a uma causalidade psicológica, reunir um vasto conjunto em relação à recusa sobre as razões profundas do agravamento do sofrimento no trabalho; a queixa das vítimas que denunciam os atentados à dignidade e recorrem à reparação contribui para a “psicologização” do debate. Mas quais reparações podem ser esperadas para um emprego perdido ou pelo prejuízo à saúde mental e/ou física? Qual a reparação possível quando a dupla “perverso/vítima” se revela mais complexa que o previsto em sua construção e o relato do assediado traz à tona sua participação (passiva, na melhor das hipóteses) no assédio de outra pessoa antes do seu? Qual a reparação possível quando o próprio algoz denunciado se revela preso em uma trama de constrangimentos na qual ele também precisa lutar para defender sua saúde? Qual a reparação possível quando um coletivo de trabalho persegue obstinadamente um dos seus membros para não entrar em colapso

Evidentemente, quando a escolha de uma profissão é coerente com as necessidades do sujeito e suas modalidades de exercício permitem o livre jogo do funcionamento mental e corporal, o trabalho ocupa um lugar central no equilíbrio psicossomático, pois a situação de trabalho age sobre a economia dos corpos em diversos níveis. Se a tarefa carrega um conteúdo simbólico, se o trabalho permite, apesar das limitações do real e da organização, um exercício inventivo dos corpos, ele se torna fonte de prazer e sublimação. Psiquismo e corpo trabalham juntos para uma produção valorizadora. Os gestos de trabalho podem, então, reduzir-se a encadeamentos biomecânicos eficazes e operatórios. Eles são “atos de expressão da postura psíquica e social que o sujeito dirige ao próximo” (Dejours; Dessors; Molinier, 1994); eles participam da construção da identidade

O corpo envolvido no trabalho é um corpo instrumento cujo desempenho é atribuído ao peso, ao tamanho, à corpulência, à musculatura, à idade, isto é, um corpo reduzido a suas características físicas e fisiológicas”[29]. “O segundo corpo comprometido no trabalho é um corpo incerto, cujo estado de saúde, ritmo, limitações, variabilidade, impotências, cansaço, deficiências, doenças são conjugados com estados afetivos: dor, sofrimento, prazer, excitação, emoção, sentimento, desejo, erotismo. A organização do trabalho opõe ao segundo corpo uma desmentida enérgica. Ela valoriza a disciplinarização dos corpos, sua biodisponibilidade. O corpo é admitido apenas como reservatório de força, de poder. O corpo, na organização do trabalho, é um meio, não uma origem” (Dejours, 2000)

No processo de assédio, a repetição, consciente ou inconsciente, das críticas, das humilhações, das culpabilizações e das prescrições paradoxais cria rapidamente um impasse no trabalho de elaboração mental e adquire um poder de efração psíquica. Por outro lado, a impossibilidade de pedir demissão, sob pena de perder seus direitos sociais, é uma barreira à fuga. A subordinação própria à definição jurídica do contrato de trabalho confina o trabalhador em uma toxicidade contextual quase experimental. A obstrução das vias de escoamento das excitações traumáticas leva ao colapso depressivo e à via somática mais ou menos a longo prazo

Na psicodinâmica do trabalho, uma atenção particular é dada, certamente, aos mecanismos de defesa individuais, mas também às estratégias coletivas de defesa. Estas, destinadas a lutar contra o sofrimento no trabalho, são específicas de cada local e produzidas, estabilizadas e mantidas coletivamente. Trata-se principalmente de lutar contra o medo gerado pelo trabalho opondo a ele uma recusa coletiva de percepção. Na construção dessa recusa, a virilidade social desempenha um papel preponderante. A exaltação viril não oferece somente uma compensação narcisista, ela se torna, às vezes, uma verdadeira ideologia defensiva que, compartilhada por todos os membros de um coletivo de trabalho, veda a expressão do medo e, mais amplamente, do sofrimento no trabalho. Um líder de verdade deve, para ter êxito, conseguir ignorar o medo e o sofrimento, os seus e os do próximo. O cinismo se torna um equivalente de força de caráter. A tolerância ao sofrimento infligido ao próximo é transformada em valor positivo. O poder social é medido pela capacidade de exercer sobre os outros violências consideradas necessárias, que autorizam a utilização de práticas deletérias como método de gerenciamento para obter a rendição emocional de todos. A criação dos assediadores está baseada, então, na internalização psíquica e corporal de técnicas sistematizadas, permitindo aderir ao mundo do trabalho e se entender com os princípios de pertencimento ao grupo dominante que valorizam tenacidade, disciplina e provas corporais

Colocar pressão, também, quando as pessoas voltam de férias.

se um suicídio acontece, ele indica certamente a solidão psicológica atroz na qual se encontrava o suicida; solidão psicológica que é, antes de tudo, uma solidão afetiva, eu destaco, porque esses suicídios ocorrem em uma comunidade de trabalho que, provavelmente, tem comunidade apenas no nome. Muito provavelmente, trata-se de um agrupamento de pessoas para o trabalho de produção, mas esse agrupamento não tem, ou deixou de ter, depositário afetivo. Solidão afetiva em meio à multidão é, provavelmente, o primeiro significado que é preciso decifrar no suicídio nos locais de trabalho. E isso indica uma outra pista. Se aquele ou aquela que se suicidou estava efetivamente só em meio à multidão, o que dizer da natureza e da qualidade das relações entre esses outros homens e mulheres que formavam a multidão no trabalho

Para a empresa, o trabalho deve ser a preocupação absolutamente prioritária dos colaboradores. Pedir um tempo parcial é indicar que outra coisa conta tanto quanto a empresa na sua vida. A empresa exige, de fato, docilidade, autocensura, silêncio absoluto sobre qualquer problema pessoal não profissional e, principalmente, submissão total.

Ceder, desinvestir, é admitir que toda essa implicação subjetiva, ao ser repudiada brutalmente pela empresa, de nada serviu, que ela não nos dá direito a nenhum reconhecimento, que todas as gratificações recebidas até então eram estritamente cínicas e instrumentais, isto é, que fomos enganados, e que agora somos jogados para escanteio. Mas isso não é tudo, é ainda mais difícil: é necessário admitir não apenas que fomos enganados

Enganamos a nós mesmos ao acreditar na empresa, no trabalho, no zelo, na utilidade do esforço, das renúncias, do sofrimento; enganamo-nos nessa crença de que, com o sucesso econômico, vem a emancipação. Certamente, havíamos hesitado em crer e nos lançarmos na aventura. É talvez isso que torne o fracasso ainda mais cruel. Em vez de reconhecimento e emancipação, a Sra. V. B. encontra exatamente o contrário: ao fim de sua contribuição para o esforço econômico da empresa e depois do sucesso, há o retrocesso implacável da injunção à submissão, que logo se torna uma ordem para tirar o time de campo

nenhum trabalho de qualidade é possível sem o envolvimento total da subjetividade. Enfrentar o real do trabalho, isto é, o que se revela àquele que trabalha por sua resistência aos savoir-faire, à técnica, ao conhecimento, isto é, ao controle, implica, para quem não desiste diante das dificuldades, a mobilização de uma inteligência e engenhosidade que passam por transformações da subjetividade e da personalidade. Trabalhar nunca é tão somente produzir; é, no mesmo movimento, transformar-se a si mesmo.

a empresa é capaz de utilizar a falha tanto como potência de trabalho quanto como retransmissor da desestabilização psicológica, conforme bem entender, bastando, para isso, tomar as decisões administrativas: primeiro, gratificar; depois, repudiar ou perseguir. A empresa explora nossas vulnerabilidades e não há, talvez, nada de condenável nessa atitude, dado que, em alguns casos, podemos também nos beneficiar disso. Em contrapartida, quando a relação com o trabalho é desestabilizada, como no caso apresentado, por formas criticáveis de gerenciamento, há riscos sérios para a saúde mental e física daquele ou daquela pego pela tempestade

A pessoa empática costuma precisar que todos estejam na mesma página que ela para que então ela consiga virar a página. Ela não quer simplesmente cortar uma relação sem que consiga dar explicação e ser compreendida. Porém, narcisistas propositalmente não deixarão que a vítima resolva e feche a questão. Ou tentarão dissuadi-la durante a conversa ou inverterão a situação, acusando-a injustamente, por exemplo, e interrompendo a comunicação de modo que a vítima sinta que ainda existem pontos a serem discutidos para que tudo “termine bem” ou termine de forma “justa”, e acaba mantendo assim sua energia ligada ao abusador. Com narcisistas nada termina bem a não ser que seja nos termos deles.

Esta técnica consiste em adotar um comportamento, diante do narcisista, de não afetação emocional, não mordendo as iscas de provocações negativas de raiva, medo etc. ou positivas, de manipulações via elogios e tentativas de reconquista etc. que ele joga. O objetivo é retirar o poder do narcisista de afetar através da emoção, não deixar que tenham acesso a vulnerabilidade da vítima.

(1)   Uma pessoa empática saudável funciona de um lugar onde seu altruísmo é consciente (tem motivações claras e limites claros), e ela tem total capacidade de dar ou não, ajudar ou não. Quando ela se abre e se decide por uma causa ou alguém, é uma escolha que faz. Sabe o que pode e/ou quer, o que não pode e/ou não quer. Nesse grau de maturidade e trabalho sobre si, o empático pode ser generoso quando percebe que deve e quer ser, mas também pode dizer “não” quando percebe que isso é o melhor a se fazer. O empático sábio sabe que muitas vezes não doar-se é o correto.

(2)   Numa categoria de consciência intermediária, a pessoa empática oscila entre uma doação altruísta e armadilhas do ego, e pode esgotar-se sem perceber e sem se ver. Há nessa pessoa, que ainda desconhece seu poder empático e suas fraquezas, uma tendência a se colocar no centro da ajuda ou salvação de situações e ou de outras pessoas. De alguma maneira ela atribui seu próprio valor a essa capacidade de doação, e este doar-se está ligado à um orgulho imaturo de “salvar” o outro, ou, pelo menos, de agradar.

negação é central na operação do distúrbio narcisista, poderíamos até considerar que além de um mecanismo de abuso, o recurso da negação está tão entranhado no modus operandi que pode ser visto igualmente como uma característica. Narcisistas tentam esconder a doença de si mesmos devido a falta de estrutura emocional para encará-la, além do medo do que isso revela sobre eles e suas intenções malignas para o mundo (o que quebraria a ilusão de que são emocionalmente saudáveis).

Gaslighting é um tipo de abuso que faz com que a vítima questione sua própria realidade. Pode ser feito com frases fortes e acusações (quando o narcisista está tendo um ataque de ira ou se sente ameaçado) ou, de forma mais sutil e cotidiana, tirando a autoconfiança da vítima a ponto de poder ser abusivo e, em seguida, negar e agir como se nada tivesse acontecido. O gaslighting é usado inclusive em caso graves em que o abusador entra na arena das agressões físicas (como bater ou estuprar), agindo em seguida como se “não fosse nada demais” ou “nada tivesse acontecido”.

Narcisistas vivem distorcendo a realidade dos outros para que o problema seja sempre de outra pessoa e nunca deles mesmos. Essa é uma das razões pelas quais escolhem ter pessoas por perto que facilitem quando jogam a culpa nelas. Pessoas empáticas/permissivas dão espaço para serem culpabilizadas sem perceber, ou quando percebem sentem dificuldade de resistir ou entrar em confronto com o outro. As vítimas costumam ser pessoas que aceitam a culpa facilmente, que duvidam de si, se sentem inadequadas e aceitam a projeção do narcisista.

A triangulação é um mecanismo de manipulação amplamente usado por personalidades narcisistas. Segundo Redwood Alter Mckinnon, a triangulação consiste em “usar uma pessoa – ou a ideia de uma pessoa – para manipular uma outra”. Sempre que uma pessoa produz tensão numa relação introduzindo uma terceira pessoa – mesmo quando essa terceira pessoa não sabe ou não tenha dado consentimento – a triangulação está sendo operada.

Pessoas empáticas/permissiva com baixa autoestima querem se sentir especiais. Abusadores sabem disse. Eles nunca vão valorizar a vítima completamente porque isso os deixaria inseguros, então eles quase validam, eles valorizam (normalmente bem diretamente, como através de palavras ou presentes) e desvalorizam em seguida (pode ser o tratamento silencioso, uma palavra rude ou um gesto de descaso) para gerar insegurança. A vítima não entenderá o que fez de errado para deixar de receber validação (já é em si um problema ela assumir que foi ela que fez algo errado quando qualquer coisa dá errado – os narcisistas adoram isso), ela tentará ser melhor e conseguir o afeto do abusador de volta, ele jogará com isso. Daí em diante, no que depender do abusador, será como a parábola da cenoura na frente do burro.

A vítima é afetada e reage emocionalmente (ou reprime a raiva ou sofrimento, o que também satisfaz o abusador), os outros que não conhecem a história por trás da fala/gesto do narcisista podem considerar a vítima sensível demais, desequilibrada, exagerada ou “maluca”.

Nossa falta de consciência sobre saúde emocional é um dos fatores que mais facilita o uso perverso de gatilhos emocionais por manipuladores sem que (quase) ninguém se dê conta. Propagandas e marketing usam amplamente técnicas de manipulação que tocam gatilhos emocionais para vender. Novelas usam gatilhos emocionais para aumentar a audiência. Os discursos políticos são grandes plataformas para puxar esses gatilhos e os procedimentos de construção de imagem de candidatos em campanhas eleitorais, de forma geral, muito se assemelham a autoimagem construída do narcisista. Nossa cultura naturaliza ainda que “profissionais da conquista” ou “coaches de relacionamentos” ofereçam cursos que ensinam seus clientes a manipularem potenciais parceiros sexuais e românticos.

Emocionalmente, narcisistas são poços sem fundo com seus egos insaciáveis. Competem, se comparam com os outros, buscam elogios de forma infantil, etc. Sempre precisam de mais controle e mais gente que os adorem cegamente, que os achem o máximo.

Narcisistas não tem amigos íntimos reais, pois não são capaz de troca afetiva genuína. Estocam pessoas para uso próprio. Eles usam suas redes de “amigos” sem pudor, jogando sutilmente uma pessoa contra a outra quando podem se beneficiar com isso. Gostam em especial de fazer com que essa rede de supostos “amigos” ou “afetos” o dispute.

Mas o que normalmente a vítima não fica sabendo, até que o conflito final ecloda, é que ao longo de toda sua convivência com o narcisista ela já era mal falada pelas costas. É assim que o narcisista funciona. E provavelmente, se a vítima conviveu muito com o narcisista, ela deve ter ouvido inúmeras vezes o mesmo fazendo campanhas de difamação sobre terceiros e pior, acreditado no que ouvia sobre outras vítimas, e, quem sabe, até propagando impressões ruins junto a ele sobre elas.

Narcisistas são “bacanas”. Entendem instintivamente como engajar o outro, pois precisam saber como afetá-lo. Aprendem ao longo da vida a simular amor e empatia para conseguir as coisas. Podem ser extremamente gentis quando querem. Os que dominam essas habilidades conseguem ser bem sucedidos socialmente apenas simulando empatia.

Greeks had slaves and banausoi—a lower class of workers, including manual laborers, skilled artisans, and tradespeople—to do the work so that the upper classes could enjoy their leisure time and participate in community life. If you’ve ever read a Jane Austen novel and wondered how those people who don’t seem to do much of anything (except hem and haw about whom to marry) got by, you get the general picture. Work, to the wealthy, was for someone else to do.3 Since the 1970s and 1980s, there has been a shift. The ownership class these days does tend to work, and indeed, to make a fetish of its long hours. But the real change has come in the lives of those of us who don’t make millions. It’s become especially important that we believe that the work itself is something to love. If we recalled why we work in the first place—to pay the bills—we might wonder why we’re working so much for so little.

O desaparecimento dos símbolos refere-se à atomização progressiva da sociedade. Ao mesmo tempo, a sociedade se torna narcisista. O processo narcisista de internalização desenvolve uma animosidade em relação à forma. As formas objetivas são rejeitadas em favor dos estados subjetivos. Os rituais são inacessíveis à interioridade narcísica. A libido do self não pode acasalar com eles. Quem se entrega a rituais tem que se esquecer de si mesmo. Os rituais geram um distanciamento de si mesmo, fazem com que se transcenda

John Maynard Keynes. He predicted in 1930 that by the early twenty-first century capital growth, improving productivity, and technological advances should have brought us to the foothills of an economic “promised land” in which everybody’s basic needs were easily satisfied and where, as a result, nobody worked more than fifteen hours in a week.

The idea that we have infinite wants but that all resources are limited sits at the beating heart of the definition of economics as the study of how people allocate scarce resources to meet their needs and desires. It also anchors our markets, financial, employment, and monetary systems. To economists, then, scarcity is what drives us to work, for it is only by working—by making, producing, and trading scarce resources—that we can ever begin to bridge the gap between our apparently infinite desires and our limited means.

we now know that hunter-gatherers like the Ju/’hoansi did not live constantly on the edge of starvation. Rather, they were usually well nourished; lived longer than people in most farming societies; rarely worked more than fifteen hours a week; and spent the bulk of their time at rest and leisure.

Where the economic problem insists that we are all cursed to live in the purgatory between our infinite desires and limited means, hunter-gatherers had few material desires, which could be satisfied with a few hours of effort. Their economic life was organized around the presumption of abundance rather than a preoccupation with scarcity.

When economists define work as the time and effort we spend meeting our needs and wants, they dodge two obvious problems. The first is that often the only thing that differentiates work from leisure is context and whether we are being paid to do something or are paying to do it. To an ancient forager, hunting an elk is work, but to many First World hunters it is an exhilarating and often very expensive leisure activity; to a commercial artist, drawing is work, but to millions of amateur artists it is a relaxing pleasure; and to a lobbyist, cultivating relationships with movers and shakers is work, but for most of the rest of us making friends is a joy. The second problem is that beyond the energy we expend to secure our most basic needs—food, water, air, warmth, companionship, and safety—there is very little that is universal about what constitutes a necessity. More than this, necessity often merges so imperceptibly with desire that it can be impossible to separate them.

When it comes to charting the history of our relationship with work, there are two intersecting pathways that are the most obvious to follow. The first maps the story of our relationship with energy. At its most fundamental, work is always an energy transaction and the capacity to do certain kinds of work is what distinguishes living organisms from dead, inanimate matter.

The second pathway follows the human evolutionary and cultural journey. Its early physical milestones take the form of rough stone tools, ancient hearths, and broken beads. Later milestones take the form of powerful engines, giant cities, stock exchanges, industrial-scale farms, nation states, and vast networks of energy-hungry machines. But this is a pathway also littered with many invisible milestones. These take the form of ideas, concepts, ambitions, hopes, habits, rituals, practices, institutions, and

But it is the points where these two pathways converge that are most important in terms of making sense of our contemporary relationship with work. The first of these points of convergence comes when humans mastered fire possibly as long as a million years ago. In learning how to outsource some of their energy needs to flames, they acquired the gift of more time free from the food-quest, the means to stay warm in the cold, and the ability to vastly extend their diets, so fueling the growth of ever more energy-hungry, harder-working brains.

The second crucial point of convergence was far more recent, and arguably far more transformative. It began some 12,000 years ago when some of our ancestors began to routinely store food and experiment with cultivation, transforming their relationships with their environments, with each other, with scarcity, and with work.

Values Objective: Adding Meaning There are many ways to add meaning to your work life. Adding Exceptional Quality. You can bring meaning to work that at frst appears to have little to offer. People derive meaning from how they work, not only what they do. You can produce products or service of exceptional quality. Meaning is evident in the process rather than the content. • For example, the process of serving doughnuts cheerfully and attentively can be a valuable contribution to the customer, outweighing the nutritional shortcomings of the product being served. • Craftspeople and artists raise mundane objects—bowls, candlesticks, and the like—to another level of signifcance through excellent work and design. • A job of modest dimensions can be a valuable learning experience, preparing an employee for positions of greater responsibility with the same company or elsewhere

After the worst part of my OCD went away in eighth grade (why? I have no fucking idea),* my parents and I never discussed what happened. We all preferred to focus instead on the things that made me happy. And that, of course, was the arts. From middle school to college I learned that, as long as I was acting or singing or writing, I had to be present in the moment. I didn’t have the mental space to be anxious. As long as I kept my mind engaged, everything would be okay. Whatever those thoughts were, they were gone and never to return again in any other form. If this sentence seems ominous, that’s because it is!

The situations will be generally muddled and stupid. Thus, I curse your daughter to become … the world’s lamest mistress.” The princess’s parents were distraught. “Why, oh why would you do this, you evil witch?!” The witch replied, “Well, to be fair, it’ll be a mix of this curse and all of the natural causes of romantic obsession. See, romantic obsession, also known as ‘limerence’ as coined by the psychologist Dorothy Tennov, naturally feeds off the thrill of the chase, so anything with a ‘forbidden’ element is especially appealing. Limerence also makes your serotonin plummet and your daughter already has low serotonin due to mild depression inherited from both sides of the family so she’ll be even more reliant on the dopamine surges caused by romantic love. BUT THE CURSE STILL PLAYS A BIG PART IN THIS HAHAHAHAHA!

Like the hundred or so other people standing with them, they, too, were desperate to score tickets for the West End production of Hamilton. It had been sold out online for months, but Harry was banking on the hope a witch or wizard might be working the box office and he could play the “I saved the world” card.

“Work” is now used to describe all transfers of energy, from those that occur on a celestial scale when galaxies and stars form to those that take place at a subatomic level. Science also now recognizes that the creation of our universe involved colossal amounts of work, and that what makes life so extraordinary and what differentiates living things from dead things are the very unusual kinds of work that living things do.

Life actively works to survive, grow, and reproduce potentially in spite of what some physicists consider to be the “supreme law of the universe”: the second law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of entropy. The second law of thermodynamics describes the tendency for all energy to distribute itself evenly across the universe.

States of low entropy are “highly ordered,” like children’s bedrooms when the children are forced to tidy up and stow their toys, gadgets, clothes, books, and tubs of slime in assorted drawers and cupboards. States of high entropy, by contrast, are similar to their rooms a few hours later, once the children have picked up and then dropped everything they own seemingly at random. According to Boltzmann’s calculations, every possible arrangement of a kid’s stuff in their

rooms is equally probable in a physical sense if children, as it appears is the case, are nothing more than random-stuff redistributors. There is of course a minuscule chance that, as random-stuff redistributors, they might accidentally put all their things back where they are supposed to be for the rooms to be considered tidy. The problem is that there are vastly more ways for the rooms to be messy than there are for them to be tidy, so the chances are hugely in favor of their rooms being messy until a parent demands they do the work—and so expend the energy necessary—to restore their rooms to an acceptably low state of entropy.

The fact that from a physicist’s perspective all living organisms do work, and that our planet’s biosphere was constructed over millions of generations as a result of the work done by their various evolutionary ancestors, raises an obvious question: How does the work done, for example, by a tree, a cuttlefish, or a zebra, differ from that which has brought our species to the cusp of creating artificial intelligence?

To make it a little less overwhelming, this book hopes to boil down the whole confusing morass into four simple questions that we can ask ourselves whenever we encounter any ethical dilemma, great or small: What are we doing? Why are we doing it? Is there something we could do that’s better? Why is it better? That’s moral philosophy and ethics2 in a nutshell—the search for answers to those four questions.

Nearly every single thing we do has some ethical component to it, whether we realize it or not. That means we owe it to ourselves to learn what the hell ethics is and how it works, so we don’t screw everything up all the time. We share this planet with other people. Our actions affect those people. If we care at all about those people, we ought to figure out how to make the best decisions we can.

A quick glance around will reveal a ton of people who have clearly decided they don’t care about being ethical, so they’re not really trying. Part of me doesn’t entirely blame them, because attempting to be a decent moral agent in the universe—a fancy way of saying “trying to do the right thing”—means we are bound to fail. Even making our best efforts to be good people, we’re gonna screw up. Constantly. We’ll make a decision we think is right and good, only to find out it was wrong and bad. We’ll do something we don’t think will affect anyone, only to find out it sure as hell did, and man are we in trouble.

rituais e cerimônias são formas de conclusão. Eles têm, desse modo, o seu tempo próprio, o seu próprio ritmo e compasso. Eles representam processos narrativos que se furtam à aceleração. Seria um sacrilégio acelerar um ato de sacrifício. Acelerar sem fm, em contrapartida, é o que um processador faz, pois ele não trabalha narrativamente, mas apenas aditivamente. Narrativas não se deixam acelerar arbitrariamente. A aceleração destrói as suas estruturas próprias de sentido e tempo. O inquietante na experiência de tempo atual não é a aceleração como tal, mas sim a conclusão faltante, ou seja, a falta do ritmo e do compasso das coisas.

A festa tem sua origem, como a celebração, em um contexto religioso. A palavra latina feriae tem uma origem sacral e signifca o tempo destinado às ações religiosas. Fatum é um lugar sagrado, dedicado à divindade, ou seja, o lugar destinado à ação religiosa. A festa começa onde o trabalho como ação pro-fana (literalmente: que se encontra diante [e, portanto, fora] do distrito sagrado) termina. O tempo da festa é diametralmente oposto ao tempo do trabalho. O fnal do expediente [Feierabend] como véspera [Vorabend] da festa anuncia um tempo sagrado. Se aquela fronteira ou umbral que separa o sagrado do profano é suspensa, resta, dessa maneira, apenas o banal e o cotidiano, a saber, o mero tempo do trabalho. E o imperativo do desempenho o explora.

When you fix your gaze on the speedy, you feel pensive, amped-up, liable to be washed away if you donâ€™t move, wave, shout. Now I found myself staring at something very old and very permanent. This ocean was here long before you, I thought, and it will be here long after your small concerns are forgotten. Twitter makes you feel that the whole world is obsessed with you and your little egoâ€”it loves you, it hates you, itâ€™s talking about you right now. The ocean makes you feel like the world is greeting you with a soft, wet, welcoming indifference. Itâ€™s never going to argue back, no matter how loud you yell.

In 1986, if you added up all the information being blasted at the average human beingâ€”TV, radio, readingâ€”it amounted to 40 newspapersâ€™ worth of information every day. By 2007, they found it had risen to the equivalent of 174 newspapers per day. (Iâ€™d be amazed if it hasnâ€™t gone up even more since then.) The increase in the volume of information is what creates the sensation of the world speeding up.

The average office worker now spends 40Â percent of their work time wrongly believing they are â€œmultitaskingâ€â€”which means they are incurring all these costs for their attention and focus. In fact, uninterrupted time is becoming rare. One study found that most of us working in offices never get a whole hour uninterrupted in a normal day. I had to look again at that figure several times before I really absorbed it: most office workers never get an hour to themselves without being interrupted.

The purpose of flow is to keep on flowing, not looking for a peak or utopia but staying in the flow. It is not a moving up but a continuous flowing; you move up to keep the flow going.â€

The first thing you need to do is to choose a clearly defined goal. I want to paint this canvas; I want to run up this hill; I want to teach my child how to swim. You have to resolve to pursue it, and to set aside your other goals while you do. Flow can only come when you are monotaskingâ€”when you choose to set aside everything else and do one thing. Mihaly found that distraction and multitasking kill flow, and nobody will reach flow if they are trying to do two or more things at the same time. Flow requires all of your brainpower, deployed toward one mission. Second, you have to be doing something that is meaningful to you. This is part of a basic truth about attention: we evolved to pay attention to things that are meaningful to us. As Roy Baumeister, the leading expert on willpower I quoted in the introduction, put it to me: â€œA frog will look at a fly it can eat much more than a stone it canâ€™t eat.â€ To a frog, a fly is meaningful and a stone is notâ€”so it easily pays attention to a fly, and rarely pays attention to a stone. This, he said, â€œgoes back to the design of the brainâ€¦. Itâ€™s designed to pay attention to the stuff that matters to you.â€ After all, â€œthe frog who sat around all day looking at stones would have starved.â€ In any situation, it will be easier to pay attention to things that are meaningful to you, and harder to pay attention to things that seem meaningless. When you are trying to make yourself do something that lacks meaning, your attention will often slip and slide off it. Third, it will help if you are doing something that is at the edge of your abilities, but not beyond them. If the goal you choose is too easy, youâ€™ll go into autopilotâ€”but if itâ€™s too hard, youâ€™ll start to feel anxious and off-kilter and you wonâ€™t flow either. Picture a rock climber who has medium-ranking experience and talent. If she clambers up any old brick wall at the back of a garden, sheâ€™s not going to get into flow because itâ€™s too easy. If sheâ€™s suddenly told to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, she wonâ€™t get into flow either because sheâ€™ll freak out. What she needs is a hill or mountain that is, ideally, slightly higher and harder than the one she did last time. So, to find flow, you need to choose one single goal; make sure your goal is meaningful to you; and try to push yourself to the edge of your abilities. Once you have created these conditions, and you hit flow, you can recognize it because itâ€™s a distinctive mental state. You feel you are purely present in the moment. You experience a loss of self-consciousness. In this state itâ€™s like your ego has vanished and you have merged with the taskâ€”like you are the rock you are climbing. By

I noticed that if I spent a day where I experienced three hours of flow early on, for the rest of the day, I felt relaxed and open and able to engageâ€”to walk along the beach, or start chatting to people, or read a book, without feeling cramped, or irritable, or phone-hungry. It was like the flow was relaxing my body and opening my mindâ€”perhaps because I knew I had done my best. I felt myself falling into a different rhythm. I realized then that to recover from our loss of attention, it is not enough to strip out our distractions. That will just create a void. We need to strip out our distractions and to replace them with sources of flow.

Until the nineteenth century, the lives of almost all humans were shaped primarily by the rise and fall of the sun. Our natural rhythms evolved to match itâ€”we would get a rush of energy when it got light, and we would feel sleepy after it got dark. For almost all of human history, our ability to intervene in this cycle was pretty limitedâ€”we could light fires, but that was it. As a result, humans evolved to be as sensitive to changes of light, Charles says, as algae and cockroaches. But suddenly, with the invention of the electric lightbulb, we gained the power to control the light we are exposed toâ€”and this power has started to scramble our internal rhythms.

The way information gets to you, McLuhan argued, is more important than the information itself. TV teaches you that the world is fast; that itâ€™s about surfaces and appearances; that everything in the world is happening all at once. This made me wonder what the message is that we absorb from social media, and how it compares to the message that we absorb from printed books. I thought first of Twitter. When you log in to that siteâ€”it doesnâ€™t matter whether you are Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders or Bubba the Love Spongeâ€”you are absorbing a message through that medium and sending it out to your followers. What is that message? First: you shouldnâ€™t focus on any one thing for long. The world can and should be understood in short, simple statements of 280 characters. Second: the world should be interpreted and confidently understood very quickly. Third: what matters most is whether people immediately agree with and applaud your short, simple, speedy statements. A successful statement is one that lots of people immediately applaud; an unsuccessful statement is one that people immediately ignore or condemn. When you tweet, before you say anything else, you are saying that at some level you agree with these three premises. You are putting on those goggles and seeing the world through them. How about Facebook? Whatâ€™s the message in that medium? It seems to be first: your life exists to be displayed to other people, and you should be aiming every day to show your friends edited highlights of your life. Second: what matters is whether people immediately like these edited and carefully selected highlights that you spend your life crafting.

What, I wondered, is the message buried in the medium of the printed book? Before the words convey their specific meaning, the medium of the book tells us several things. Firstly, life is complex, and if you want to understand it, you have to set aside a fair bit of time to think deeply about it. You need to slow down. Secondly, there is a value in leaving behind your other concerns and narrowing down your attention to one thing, sentence after sentence, page after page. Thirdly, it is worth thinking deeply about how other people live and how their minds work. They have complex inner lives just like you.

Reading, he told me, creates a â€œunique form of consciousnessâ€¦. While weâ€™re reading, weâ€™re directing attention outward toward the words on the page and, at the same time, enormous amounts of attention is going inward as we imagine and mentally simulate.â€ Itâ€™s different from if you just close your eyes and try to imagine something off the top of your head. â€œItâ€™s being structuredâ€”but our attention is in a very unique place, fluctuating both out toward the page, toward the words, and then inward, toward what those words represent.â€ Itâ€™s a way of combining â€œoutwardly directed attention and inwardly directed attention.â€ When you read fiction in particular, you imagine what it is like to be another person.

long TV series are just as effective, he said. But thereâ€™s a catch. One of his studies showed that children are more empathetic if they read storybooks or watch movies, but not if they watch shorter shows. This appears to fit, it seemed to me, with what we see on social mediaâ€”if you see the world through fragments, your empathy often doesnâ€™t kick in, in the way that it does when you engage with something in a sustained, focused way.

This, I realized, is quite challenging to the whole way I had been raised to think about productivity. I feel instinctively like Iâ€™ve done a good hard day of work when I have been sitting at my laptop, spotlight-focused on tapping out wordsâ€”at the end of it, I feel a little Puritan rush of pride at my productivity. Our whole culture is built around this belief. Your boss wants to see you sitting at your desk every hour of the day; this is what she thinks work is. This way of thinking is implanted in us from a very young age when, like Marcus Raichle, we are told off at school for daydreaming. Thatâ€™s why, on the days I spent simply wandering aimlessly on the beaches of Provincetown, I didnâ€™t feel productive. I thought I was slacking, being lazy, indulging myself. But Nathanâ€”after studying all thisâ€”had found that to be productive, you canâ€™t aim simply to narrow your spotlight as much as possible. He said: â€œI try to go for a walk every day and just let my mind kind of sort things outâ€¦. I donâ€™t think our full conscious control of our thoughts is necessarily our most productive way of thinking. I think loose patterns of association can lead to unique insight.â€ Marcus agreed. Focusing on whatâ€™s right in front of you, he told me, gives you â€œsome of the raw material that has to be digested, but at some point, you need to stand back from that.â€ He warned: â€œIf weâ€™re just frantically running around focusing on the external world exclusively, we miss the opportunity to let the brain digest whatâ€™s been going on.â€

this is a core insight of magicâ€”you can manipulate people and they donâ€™t even know itâ€™s happening. They will swear to you that they made their own free choicesâ€”as I would have about those cards. One morning, in his office in San Francisco, Tristan leaned forward and said to me: â€œHow does a magician do their work? It works because they donâ€™t have to know your strengthsâ€”they just have to know your weaknesses. How well do you know your weaknesses?â€ I wanted to believe I understood my weaknesses very well, but Tristan shook his head gently. â€œIf people did know their weaknesses,â€ he said, â€œthen magic wouldnâ€™t work.â€

When Tristan testified about this before the U.S. Senate, he asked: â€œHow can we solve the worldâ€™s most urgent problems if weâ€™ve downgraded our attention spans, downgraded our capacity for complexity and nuance, downgraded our shared truth, downgraded our beliefs into conspiracy-theory thinking, where we canâ€™t construct shared agendas to solve our problems? This is destroying our sense-making, at a time when we need it the most. And the reason why Iâ€™m here is because every day itâ€™s incentivized to get worse.â€ He said he was especially worried about this, he told me later, because we are now, as a species, facing our biggest challenge everâ€”the fact that we are destroying the ecosystem we depend on for life by triggering the climate crisis. If we canâ€™t focus, what possible hope do we have to solve global warming? So

Sagrado é o instante em que dois indivíduos fazem uso de sua consciência na tentativa de estabelecer uma troca que otimize o ganho para os dois. Fazer negócio, nos moldes imaginados pelos rabinos, coloca à prova todo o esforço da cultura e da espiritualidade e, respondendo a uma consciência, cobra do indivíduo responsabilidades para além de si próprio. Só dois santos podem entrar em gesheft; não se deve evitar gesheft por covardia; e é preciso sair do gesheft com o máximo de ganho, tendo como referência o máximo de ganho do outro e o mínimo de transtorno ou consumo para o universo. Este tipo de transação, que pressupõe a utilização não predatória e a satisfação das necessidades dos que interagem, instaura uma nova natureza.

the organization is an abstraction. Mathematically, it would have to be represented as a pointâ€”that is, as having neither size nor extension. Even the largest organization is unreal compared to the reality of the environment in which it exists. Specifically, there are no results within the organization. All the results are on the outside. The only business results, for instance, are produced by a customer who converts the costs and efforts of the business into revenues and profits through his willingness to exchange his purchasing power for the products or services of the business.

An organization, a social artifact, is very different from a biological organism. Yet it stands under the law that governs the structure and size of animals and plants: The surface goes up with the square of the radius, but the mass grows with the cube. The larger the animal becomes, the more resources have to be devoted to the mass and to the internal tasks, to circulation and information, to the nervous system, and so on.

Effectiveness, in other words, is a habit; that is, a complex of practices. And practices can always be learned. Practices are simple, deceptively so; even a seven-year-old has no difficulty in understanding a practice. But practices are always exceedingly hard to do well. They have to be acquired, as we all learn the multiplication table; that is, repeated ad nauseam until â€œ6 x 6 = 36â€ has become unthinking, conditioned reflex, and firmly ingrained habit.

Effective executives, finally, make effective decisions. They know that this is, above all, a matter of systemâ€”of the right steps in the right sequence. They know that an effective decision is always a judgment based on â€œdissenting opinionsâ€ rather than on â€œconsensus on the facts.â€ And they know that to make many decisions fast means to make the wrong decisions.

But what we can do, and what we are ethically called to do, is create a space in our schools and classrooms where all students can walk in and, for that day or hour, take off the crushing weight of their armor, hang it on a rack, and open their heart to truly being seen.

You donâ€™t even need to stomp it or kick it away. Cruelty is cheap, easy, and chickenshit. It doesnâ€™t deserve your energy or engagement.

In a laboratory, a culture is a biochemical broth custom-made to promote the development of this or that organism. Assuming the microbes in question start out with a clean bill of health and genetic fitness, a suitable and well-maintained culture should allow for their happy, healthy growth and proliferation. If the same organisms begin showing pathologies at unprecedented rates, or fail to thrive, it’s either because the culture has become contaminated or because it was the wrong mixture in the first place. Whichever the case, we could rightly call this a toxic culture—unsuitable for the creatures it is meant to support. Or worse: dangerous to their existence. It is the same with human societies. As the broadcaster, activist, and author Thom Hartmann asserts, “Culture can be healthy or toxic, nurturing or murderous.”3

“Trauma is not what happens to you but what happens inside you” is how I formulate it. Think of a car accident where someone sustains a concussion: the accident is what happened; the injury is what lasts. Likewise, trauma is a psychic injury, lodged in our nervous system, mind, and body, lasting long past the originating incident(s), triggerable at any moment. It is a constellation of hardships, composed of the wound itself and the residual burdens that our woundedness imposes on our bodies and souls: the unresolved emotions they visit upon us; the coping dynamics they dictate; the tragic or melodramatic or neurotic scripts we unwittingly but inexorably live out; and, not least, the toll these take on our bodies.

When a wound doesn’t mend on its own, one of two things will happen: it can either remain raw or, more commonly, be replaced by a thick layer of scar tissue. As an open sore, it is an ongoing source of pain and a place where we can be hurt over and over again by even the slightest stimulus. It compels us to be ever vigilant—always nursing our wounds, as it were—and leaves us limited in our capacity to move flexibly and act confidently lest we be harmed again. The scar is preferable, providing protection and holding tissues together, but it has its drawbacks: it is tight, hard, inflexible, unable to grow, a zone of numbness. The original healthy, alive flesh is not regenerated. Raw wound or scar, unresolved trauma is a constriction of the self, both physical and psychological.

As Peter Levine writes, trauma “is about a loss of connection—to ourselves, our families, and the world around us. This loss is hard to recognize, because it happens slowly, over time. We adapt to these subtle changes; sometimes without noticing them.”

Here’s a fairly reliable process-of-elimination checklist. It is not trauma if the following remain true over the long term: – It does not limit you, constrict you, diminish your capacity to feel or think or to trust or assert yourself, to experience suffering without succumbing to despair or to witness it with compassion. – It does not keep you from holding your pain and sorrow and fear without being overwhelmed and without having to escape habitually into work or compulsive self-soothing or self-stimulating by whatever means. – You are not left compelled either to aggrandize yourself or to efface yourself for the sake of gaining acceptance or to justify your existence. – It does not impair your capacity to experience gratitude for the beauty and wonder of life.

Emotions, he stressed, emerge not from the thinking brain but from ancient brain structures associated with survival. They are drivers and guarantors of life and development. Intense rage activates the fight response; intense fear mobilizes flight. Therefore, if the circumstances dictate that these natural, healthy impulses (to defend or run away) must be quelled, their gut-level cues—the feelings themselves—will have to be suppressed as well. No alarm, no mobilization. If this seems self-defeating, it is so only in a limited sense: on an existential level, it is the “least worst” option, being the only available one that reduces risk of further harm. The result is a tamping down of one’s feeling-world and often, for extra protection, the hardening of one’s psychic shell.

What is lost is well described by the Polish-born writerfn4 Eva Hoffman as “nothing more or less than the experience of experience itself. And what is that? Perhaps something like the capacity to enter into the textures or sensations of the moment; to relax enough so as to give oneself over to the rhythms of an episode or a personal encounter, to follow the thread of feeling or thought without knowing where it leads, or to pause long enough for reflection or contemplation.”16 Ultimately, what we are distracted from is living.

seeing trauma as an internal dynamic grants us much-needed agency. If we treat trauma as an external event, something that happens to or around us, then it becomes a piece of history we can never dislodge. If, on the other hand, trauma is what took place inside us as a result of what happened, in the sense of wounding or disconnection, then healing and reconnection become tangible possibilities. Trying to keep awareness of trauma at bay hobbles our capacity to know ourselves.

The renowned American stress researcher Bruce McEwenfn4 popularized the word “allostasis” to capture the body’s attempt to maintain inner equilibrium in the face of changing circumstances. The term is a combination of the Greek words allo, for “variable,” and stasis, for “standing” or “stoppage”; combined, we have something like “staying the same amid change.”

The pioneering U.S. internist and psychiatrist George Engel argued nearly half a century ago that the “crippling flaw” of modern medicine “is that it does not include the patient and his attributes as a person. Yet in the everyday work of the physician the prime object of study is a person.” We must make provision for the whole person in their full “psychological and social nature,”1 he said, calling for a biopsychosocial approach: one that recognizes the unity of emotions and physiology, knowing both to be dynamic processes unfolding in a context of relationships, from the personal to the cultural.

The recently deceased Buddhist monk and renowned spiritual leader Thich Nhat Hanh long taught the concept of “interbeing.” It’s not merely that we are, he said: we “inter-are.” “There are no separate entities,” he wrote, “only manifestations that rely on each other to be possible.”17 Again, we would be quite mistaken to relegate these observations to the realm of mystical belief. A scientist lacking a spiritual bone in his body, yet conversant with the growing body of evidence, would nod in agreement: “Yup, that about covers it.”

As Dr. Epel told me, the effects of our socioeconomic environment are visible within our cells, if one knows what to look for. “The neighborhood deprivation, the crime, the income of the zip code,” she said, “all of that is associated with aging of the cells. That is to me one of the biggest demonstrations that our health is outside of our body.” Dr. Szyf spoke in similar tones: “For a century we’ve been obsessed with chemical changes, thinking anything that is chemical is true and anything that is not chemical is not true. What epigenetics taught us is that social changes are really not different than chemical changes.”

If Iâ€™m honest with them about whatâ€™s happening, theyâ€™ll think less of me or maybe even use it against me. No way am I going to be honest about this. No one else does it. Why do I have to put myself out there? Yeah. Screw them. I donâ€™t see them being honest about what scares them. And theyâ€™ve got plenty of issues.

you have become a victim of dictatorial control under your own mindâ€™s constant pressure and harsh judgment. When you fall short of perfect compliance with your internal commands, you set yourself up to feel guilt, self-blame, discouragement, and depression. When others donâ€™t comply with the expectations implicit in your rules, you feel anger, frustration, disappointment, and reproach.

The Ten Commandments of People-Pleasing 1. I should always do what others want, expect, or need from me. 2. I should take care of everyone around me whether they ask for help or not. 3. I should always listen to everyoneâ€™s problems and try my best to solve them. 4. I should always be nice and never hurt anyoneâ€™s feelings. 5. I should always put other people first, before me. 6. I should never say â€œnoâ€ to anyone who needs or requests something of me. 7. I should never disappoint anyone or let others down in any way. 8. I should always be happy and upbeat and never show any negative feelings to others. 9. I should always try to please other people and make them happy. 10. I should try never to burden others with my own needs or problems. There is really a hidden eleventh commandment as well: I should fulfill all of these should and shouldnâ€™t expectations of myself completely and perfectly.

The Seven Deadly Shoulds 1. Other people should appreciate and love me because of all the things I do for them. 2. Other people should always like and approve of me because of how hard I work to please them. 3. Other people should never reject or criticize me because I always try to live up to their desires and expectations. 4. Other people should be kind and caring to me in return because of how well I treat them. 5. Other people should never hurt me or treat me unfairly because I am so nice to them. 6. Other people should never leave or abandon me because of how much I make them need me. 7. Other people should never be angry with me because I would go to any length to avoid conflict, anger, or confrontation with them.

Dr. Hans Selye, the father of modern concepts of stress and stress-induced illness, endorsed a qualified version of this belief. Selye argued that the best way for human beings to protect themselves from interpersonal stress was to be kind and giving to others. Selye believed that this was critically important as a way to live because the stress caused by other people is deadly.5

Selye called his philosophy of stress management â€œaltruistic egoism.â€ This mouthful of a phrase is intended to mean that by earning the goodwill of others through the generosity of your character and action, you are actually acting in your own self-interest. If you are kind and giving to others, Selye argued, other people will tend to be kind in return and, therefore, wonâ€™t be as likely to cause you stress.

You can easily become a victim of your own competence. The more you demonstrate that you can do, the more others expect or allow you to do. Eventually, though, the vicious cycle of people-pleasing and putting others first will render you stressed, exhausted, depleted, and depressed. At this point, in sheer desperation, your needs will be screaming to be heard. But, like Sarahâ€™s, your needs might be screaming in the dark with no one to answer them.

In psychological terms, ability and effort are considered compensatory traits. This means that a person who is perceived as having high ability is expected to have to work less hard than someone with lesser ability. Conversely, when a person of lesser ability does get ahead, they are typically viewed as having had to exert a substantial and extraordinary effort.

Your avoidance of â€œnoâ€ may also be linked to the self-esteem you think you earn by doing things for others. In this sense, by saying â€œnoâ€ to a request, you will also be denying yourself an opportunity to add one more count to the sum of tasks and favors you accomplish on behalf of others. Since your self-worth seems to depend on the things you do for other people, your reluctance to turn down a chance to add another point to your tally of accomplishments is understandable.

You need to say â€œno,â€ to some people, some of the time, in order to preserve your ability to give to the people that really matter most in your life. You need to treat yourself as well as you treat others. Saying â€œyesâ€ when you want to say â€œnoâ€ in order to protect your emotional, physical health or well-being should make you feel guiltyâ€”not the other way around. Your value as a human being does not depend on the things you do for others. Saying â€œnoâ€ some of the time to some of the people will in no way diminish your value or worth in their eyes.

In this psycho-logic, doing something â€œbadâ€ is equated with being â€œbad;â€ and, doing something â€œgoodâ€ is the same as being â€œgood.â€ The consequences of growing up in this conditional emotional environment are that the child connects pleasing others with being â€œgood,â€ which means being deserving and worthy of love. Conversely, being â€œbadâ€ means that others disapprove of you.

The alcohol abuserâ€™s world is a confusing and burdensome place for children. It is frightening, too, because parentsâ€”those all-powerful adults that are supposed to be in charge and take care of the kidsâ€”are barely able to take care of themselves. The parents are out of control of their drinking, while the children feel just plain out of control.

If you are still trying to live up to your parentsâ€™ expectations as a way to gain approval, you were probably exposed to one of two causal scenarios. First, as a child, you may have been so extravagantly praised and adored by one or both parents that any other source of approval or appraisal pales in comparison. Nobody can make you feel as good about yourself, as important, as talented, or special as your parents.

Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with wanting to make a man you love happy or wanting to please him. Just be sure that youâ€™re not pleasing him by hurting yourself in the process. In healthy love the feeling is, â€œI need you because I love you.â€ In unhealthy love based on deficiencies the feeling is, â€œI love you because I need you.â€

people-pleasers are too willing to assume blame when a problemâ€”any problemâ€”occurs in their relationships. You probably believe that doing so is a way to avoid further anger or confrontation. However, the reality is that by assuming blame, you merely reinforce and justify the anger that is being directed or misdirected toward you.

The compromised executive functioning of the ADHD brain makes all things weigh in as equally important, thereby making sorting, selecting, and tossing a real challenge.

Your brainâ€™s circuitry finds it difficult to prioritize (Do I pay the bill first or send in the wedding RSVP?), stick withâ€œboringâ€ tasks (Paperwork is so boring. I think Iâ€™ll play a video game instead), or sort (Do I file it under â€œCarâ€ or stick it in â€œBills Paidâ€?). Do you also have trouble starting or stopping a task? If so, you are not alone. Starting requires prioritizing and decision making. Stopping is hard because once you get into a task, you may tend to hyperfocus and have time distortionâ€”what seems like five minutes is actually thirty or vice versaâ€”as well as difficulty transitioning from one activity to another.

Gather enough index cards to cover seven to ten dinner menus, one menu per card. On each card, write out the entire meal for one nightâ€”for example, roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and green beans. If a recipe is needed, write down the name of the cookbook and the page number. Write down the approximate amount of time needed to prepare and cook the meal. On the other side of the card, list all the ingredients needed. If itâ€™s a quick and easy recipe requiring less than 15 minutes of prep, make a notation like a red star or â€œQEâ€ (quick and easy). Look at your planner first thing in the morning. (Use of a planner will be addressed in chapter 4, on time management.) Choose a card that matches your schedule for the day/evening.

To avoid sensory overload when grocery shopping, shop at smaller, quieter markets. To avoid the tendency to overshop, bring a shopping list or take along your POS cards. To avoid feeling overwhelmed by the chaos of a lot of people, shop at off times. Wear a headset and listen to calming music. Leave the kids at home. For larger stores, draw a diagram so you know exactly where to go to find your items.

If your working memory and executive function are impaired, then it will be extremely difficult to have an internal sense of time that cues you on getting to places on time and judging how long it takes to complete a task. (Youâ€™re more likely to under- or overestimate the time needed). These contribute to the likelihood that you will be chronically late, procrastinate on important projects, avoid unpleasant tasks, and simply forget to do things. Time seems to simply fly out the window.

Many women with ADHD are underemployed and underpaid because they are afraid of taking the leap into a job they fear might be too difficult for them, resulting in many unhappy years stuck in dead-end, boring, or stressful jobs. And even if you land that job you had always hoped for, your ADHD can hit you squarely between the eyes. Even in a job you love, your unmet ADHD needs can cause many hardships, transforming otherwise wonderful employment into the job from hell.

Perfectionism is self-destructive simply because perfection doesnâ€™t exist. Itâ€™s an unattainable goal. Perfectionism is more about perception than internal motivation, and there is no way to control perception, no matter how much time and energy we spend trying. Perfectionism is addictive, because when we invariably do experience shame, judgment, and blame, we often believe itâ€™s because we werenâ€™t perfect enough. Rather than questioning the faulty logic of perfectionism, we become even more entrenched in our quest to look and do everything just right. Perfectionism actually sets us up to feel shame, judgment, and blame, which then leads to even more shame and self-blame: Itâ€™s my fault. Iâ€™m feeling this way because Iâ€™m not good enough.

When we feel joy, it is a place of incredible vulnerabilityâ€”itâ€™s beauty and fragility and deep gratitude and impermanence all wrapped up in one experience. When we canâ€™t tolerate that level of vulnerability, joy actually becomes foreboding, and we immediately move to self-protection. Itâ€™s as if we grab vulnerability by the shoulders and say, â€œYou will not catch me off guard. You will not sucker-punch me with pain. I will be prepared and ready for you.â€

foreboding joy often shows up in more subtle and pernicious ways. It shows up by making us hesitant to celebrate victories, for two primary reasons. The first is that weâ€™re afraid if we celebrate with our team, or have a moment where we just breathe, weâ€™re inviting disaster and something will go wrong. You can likely identify with that feeling of getting a project up and out the door and then refusing to celebrate it with high-fives because you think, We canâ€™t celebrate right now because we donâ€™t know if itâ€™s going to be perfect, we donâ€™t know if itâ€™s going to work, we donâ€™t know if the site will stay upâ€¦ The second way foreboding joy shows up at work is withholding recognition. We donâ€™t want our employees to get too excited because thereâ€™s still so much work to be done.

What is the one thing that people who can fully lean into joy have in common? Gratitude. They practice gratitude. Itâ€™s not an â€œattitude of gratitudeâ€â€”itâ€™s an actual practice. They keep a journal, or make a note of what theyâ€™re grateful for on their phones, or share it with family members.

Whether weâ€™re leading a group or a member of the team, whether weâ€™re working in a formal or informal recognition program, it is our responsibility to say to the people who work alongside us: â€œWeâ€™ve got to stop and celebrate one another and our victories, no matter how small. Yes, thereâ€™s more work to be done, and things could go sideways in an hour, but that will never take away from the fact that we need to celebrate an accomplishment right now.â€

Pouca coisa prendia Elke ao Brasil, aos dezenove anos de idade. Depois de fazer um teste de aptidão para descobrir o que estudar na universidade, Elke ouviu que deveria ser médica. E se dedicou. Estudou em casa por um ano, enquanto dava aulas particulares de línguas, e conseguiu passar na Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. Em sua sala, de trinta pessoas, havia duas mulheres. Entrar na faculdade de medicina foi uma vitória, mas também a decisão que considerou o maior erro de sua vida. “A única coisa que eu escolhi, escolhi errado.” Ela comentava das vezes que ficou com o estômago embrulhado dentro da sala de aula. O enjoo não era por lidar com doentes ou dissecar cadáveres, ela nem chegou ao ponto de tocar num corpo humano. O que a enojava era a postura dos outros médicos. “Um monte de doutores de dezenove anos que nem haviam começado a se formar ainda. Eles não tinham um rei na barriga, tinham uma família real. Não era pra mim.”

The outer self was "strong" and "independent" (especially as compared with how women were sup-posed to be). The inner self was stricken with doubt; self-effacing.

Lurking behind the quest for perpetual motion that has so fascinated scientists since the Middle Ages is the fantasy of overcoming this law, of going on without ever having to stop. The law of inertia is a cruel master. The ball we throw will hit a wall, the clock’s mechanism will run down, our feet will stop dancing: whatever the body in motion, animate or inanimate, infinitesimally small or cosmically large, some or other ‘unbalanced force’ will sooner or later impede its progress. In this respect we are physical entities like any other, subject to the burden of our own weight. We can only move so far and do so much before we are forced to stop.

Our perpetual busyness is fuelled by a culture that derides or trivializes the need to stop.

We carry within ourselves an idealized self-image, or ‘ego ideal’ in Freud’s terminology, that presses us to do and achieve more. The ego ideal is the residue in us of an unconscious belief, transmitted to us by our parents from earliest infancy, in our own perfectibility. While it can serve as a spur to ambition and creativity, it is also liable to become insidiously punishing, inducing feelings of shame and inadequacy at the gap between who we are and who we feel we should be. Where the ego ideal assures us, ‘You can’, the more famous agency of the unconscious mind known as the superego dictates, ‘You must’, provoking punitive guilt at our low levels of conscientiousness and responsibility. The interplay of external and internal messages ensures that most of us experience some level of anxiety regarding our limits: no sooner do we come to a stop than voices assail us from without and within, demanding we start again.

French sociologist Alain Ehrenberg calls ‘the weariness of the self’, a state he diagnosed, in his seminal 1998 book of that title, as the essential malaise of our time. The weariness of which Ehrenberg speaks is expressed in a feeling of radical inhibition, a chronic incapacity to act. In our contemporary consumer society, the places where we work, conduct relationships and consume arouse intense competitive and rivalrous impulses. Enervated by perpetual demands to choose and to act, we are prone to slip into a debilitating paralysis of will and desire. ‘Holding back, freezing, braking, suspension of activity, and so on,’ writes Ehrenberg, ‘are all part of the language of apathy.’

Neurasthenia manifested in a diffuse proliferation of symptoms, including, as Beard wrote in 1869, ‘debility of all the functions, poor appetite, abiding weakness in the back and spine, fugitive neuralgic pains, hysteria, insomnia, hypochondriasis, disinclination for consecutive mental labour, severe and weakening attack of sick headache, and other analogous symptoms’. In neurasthenia, these symptoms have no organic basis, but are the effect of the overloading of the nerves by the unmanageable rush of sensations, demands and anxieties generated by modern life.

It is culturally acceptable for us to complain aloud about how busy and how tired we are, as though in doing so we reassure the world that we fully acknowledge our moral and social obligation to work and contribute.

This experience was vividly depicted in Graham Greene’s 1960 novel A Burnt-Out Case (the title likely helped bring the term into general circulation). Greene parallels the mental and spiritual burnout of his architect protagonist, Querry, with the ‘burnt-out cases’ of leprosy he witnesses in a Congolese leper colony. Just as feeling in the limb stumps of the lepers around him has been extinguished, so Querry believes he’s ‘come to the end of desire’ and is waiting out the rest of his life in a state of weary indifference, his emotions cut off like amputated limbs.

In recent years there has been a plethora of popular books, articles and TED talks addressing the ever greater proliferation of public and private decisions that confront us in the networked age, suggesting remedies for our inertia in the face of the choices they impose, offering to usher us through the thicket of our anxious uncertainty to the discovery of what we really want. None of these contemplate the possibility that what we really want is to be allowed to choose nothing. So thoroughly internalized is the spirit of compulsory activity governing our culture that we cannot let ourselves hear or even imagine the wish to put a stop to it.

In my consulting room, such impossible dilemmas often conceal a desperate appeal: tell me what to do, cause the sky to fall in, do something, anything, so I don’t have to choose. With this appeal, a patient might seek to fend off both the unendurable agitation that comes with not choosing and the irremediable loss and pain implied in choosing. Our predicament is that we care about, want, prefer in so many diverse and contradictory ways that we can’t help wishing we didn’t, can’t help getting snared in the desire for non-desire. If only we could be rabbits.

During the early 1990s Saitō Tamaki, a young, psychoanalytically oriented Japanese psychiatrist working as a therapist in a hospital to the east of Tokyo, found himself inundated by requests for consultation from parents of children who had become chronically withdrawn. The stories were strikingly similar even as they proliferated; adolescents and young adults, largely though not exclusively male, were giving up school, work or any other engagement with the world outside and retreating into the privacy of their bedrooms. In the years that followed, Tamaki devoted himself to clinical and theoretical research into these young people’s lives, discovering in the process an epidemic of social withdrawal or shakaiteki hikikomori, affecting as many as a million individuals and their families, a figure eventually confirmed in a 2010 survey by the Japanese Cabinet Office. With regular media appearances and the publication of his best-selling book Hikikomori in 1998, Tamaki conferred on these lives, now known popularly as hikikomori, a place in the Japanese public conversation they have held ever since.

Her exceptional smartness, creativity and energy were evident from very early on, nurtured by parents who shuttled her tirelessly from school to ballet, art class and piano, providing homework support, nutritious meals and cheerleading along the way. Their unvarying message, often conveyed explicitly, was that she could be and do anything she wanted. It is, of course, a (if not the) pervasive message of our culture of achievement, whether in the form of Disney’s sunny assurances, Nike’s brash imperative or the slogans of self-styled management gurus and executive coaches. But Sofia’s parents personalized it for her, put emotional flesh on its hollow bones, so that it wasn’t merely a generalized formula beamed in from the outside, but a demand stalking her from within.

The ego ideal is a strange and ambiguous taskmaster. Setting itself up in us as a loving ally that only wants the best for us, it is harder to resist or defy than the superego (which Freud introduced a decade after the ego ideal). Where the superego denies us what we want, the ego ideal, like the tyrannically loving parent, only wants what we want, perhaps more than we do ourselves. Its exhortations are liable to leave us forever jumping through hoops, anxiously eyeing the next target, perpetually wary of falling short of where one could be. In the shadow of the ego ideal, Han suggests, ‘the feeling of having achieved a goal never occurs’ (the emphasis is his).

An oft-repeated speculation of Freud’s has it that in the evolution of our species, our heads were originally in close proximity to our anal and genital organs. In setting them at a distance, evolution encouraged us to disown our animal origins, to renounce our dog-like shamelessness with regard to excretion and sex. Straightening our backs and tilting our chins up towards the firmament, we freed our heads from the disgusting and arousing smells of our intimate bodily selves. Cleaving to the ground, we were slaves of chaotic and untameable matter; raised into the air, we acquired dignity and the order and discipline of form. The slob disturbs us because he puts us in touch with that formless, muddy region of the self we thought we’d risen above. You feel it when you sink exhausted into the sofa, abandoning yourself to gravity’s inexorable downward pull. You feel it when your mind yields to its own sludgy undertow of blank stupidity, when all your inner voice

To be passive isn’t so much to challenge the rules of the game as to refuse to participate in it at all. For the ‘earnest person’ – that is, for anyone who sees the world as a serious place in which to conduct oneself seriously – ‘I’m not doing anything’ is the most intolerable of provocations. It hints that life could be lived without any discernible aim or desire. What is often said exasperatedly of slobs or wasters is also said of ghosts: they seem to be there but they’re not.

The human species, claims Freud in his 1930 book Civilization and Its Discontents, is founded on two basic tendencies: ‘the compulsion to work’ and ‘the power of love’. These are the forces ensuring the expansion, development and progress of civilization. Freud named the energy feeding work and love ‘libido’ (a Latin word meaning wish or desire), a term that has since passed into popular parlance to denote an individual’s sex drive. This casual use captures one important aspect of the word as Freud used it; unlike Jung, who defined it as a generalized mental life force, he saw libido as a specifically sexual energy. But Freud’s term connotes much more than physical appetite for sex. Libido is a sexual energy, but human beings have the unique capacity to ‘desexualize’ it – that is, to put in the service of non-sexual aims such as creative work, play and intellectual enquiry. Libido is the intensity or passion we invest in any object, enterprise or person we care about. Understood in this way, it starts to sound like a kind of motor fuel for life, powering our journey through the world.

Every musician plays differently, we know this, but there must be something intangible that differentiates the music written on a chart from what is created by one drummer to the next. Is it the way that each mind interprets a pattern? The internal clock that is defined by one’s physical and emotional construct? The way they see the space between the notes? I have watched many producers try to explain and manufacture “feel,” but I am convinced that over-intellectualizing it is futile. It is something divine that only the universe can create, like a heartbeat or a star. A solitary design within every musician that is only their own. I liken “feel” to the cadence of poetry, sometimes comforting, other times unsettling, but always a gift from one soul to another. A romance between the giver and receiver which serves as the punctation of one’s truth.

Art ushers us into the imaginary world, where the rules and logic and facts governing life in the real world are abolished at a stroke. Doing things in the realm of reality is hard work, for reality allows us to operate only in a small corner of the world, where it intrudes endless obstacles – the limited capacities of our bodies and minds, the iron laws of the physical and social worlds. But the white page, blank canvas or bare stage invites us to bend, break, remake and unmake the world at will, to inhabit infinite selves, places and times beyond our own.

‘Today,’ he wrote on the day of his release, ‘is the day that certain people, upon whom my fate depends, presume to give me back my freedom – as if they had taken it away from me! … They may have forbidden me to travel through a city, one place, but they left me the entire universe: infinity and eternity are at my command.’

Dutch Catholic theologian, Desiderius Erasmus, a leading figure of the emerging humanism of the day, published The Praise of Folly, a lengthy mock-sermon delivered by the figure of Folly, personified as a woman in a jester’s suit. Folly employs every known rhetorical trick to persuade her listeners of the superiority of the foolish orientation of life. She recounts her origins as the child of Plutus, god of riches, and Neotes or Youth, the fairest of all nymphs.

Reality needs the imagination if it is to grow and transform. But this dependence doesn’t prevent them from coming into conflict. Daydreamers display a stubborn resistance to reality’s claims and demands, resist submitting to the imperatives of social and economic utility.

Freud suggests that this is how creative writers are made. In turning away from the burdensome demands of reality, he says in his tellingly titled 1908 essay ‘Creative Writers and Daydreaming’, they immerse themselves in the weightless atmosphere of their daydreams and fantasies, shaping them into characters and stories, providing pleasurable diversions for those idle intervals in the busy lives of real people.

Whatever seriousness art can lay claim to, it isn’t the seriousness of science. In science, even the most speculative theory is ultimately concerned with the real world, whereas in art, even objects as concrete as a urinal or an unmade bed belong to the imaginary world.

It is precisely this capacity of art to distinguish itself from ordinary reality that led Freud to conclude that while art may be fascinating, it cannot be serious in the way science is. Much as he admired and even revered art, he couldn’t be persuaded of its capacity to intervene in and transform the world around us.

Action, Wilde suggests, is ‘limited and relative’. In its exclusive concern with the here and now, it suffocates our imaginative possibilities. ‘The vision of him who sits at ease and watches’, in contrast, is ‘unlimited and absolute’. In liberating the self from the pressure to act, psychoanalysis radically enlarges the scope of what we can think and feel. One of the most understated yet important qualities of psychoanalytic speech, or ‘free association’, is the capacity it encourages in the speaker to follow the trail of his mind in the absence of any clue as to where it might be going.

Overwork, overstimulation, perpetual communication, anxiety, insomnia: the social and material conditions of our everyday lives are profoundly inhospitable to the kind of receptive, inactive patience which sustains all forms of creative life. Physical and mental busyness are ways of entrenching a kind of inertial sameness, into which the unknown and unexpected cannot intrude. Being is the essential antidote to the non-stop inertia of doing, a way of resisting the gravity that drags us downwards.

The anarchy and madness of her unconscious life didn’t disappear; but they found words and shapes and sounds that made her dreams and fantasies thinkable, available as creative resources rather than cut off as hostile internal forces. The unconscious could never become an unambiguous ally, but it ceased to be an enemy. From being the helpless victim of her psychic life, she became, with me alongside her, its curious interlocutor.

Withdrawal into the solitude of a bedroom has been a recurring motif of this book: for Tracey Emin, a descent into the apocalyptic depths of her own depression; for the young hikikomori, a rejection of work, society and the pressures of an attainment society; for Xavier de Maistre, an enforced but unexpectedly joyous discovery of the infinitude to be found within the tightest restrictions. Withdrawal signifies a refusal of the limits and constrictions we impose upon ourselves as soon as we commit to this or that project or institution – a country, a profession, a marriage. Live here and we cannot live there, do one job and we cannot do another, marry one person and forsake not only all others but independence. For Dickinson to go to her Lord in Salem would mean an expansion of her place in the world, but a constriction of her imaginative life. No nineteenth-century bride, however gentle and undemanding her groom, could expect to maintain the permanent and sovereign freedom of a locked room.

I was approached by a young Japanese man who was shaking like a leaf, on the verge of tears. “Did you not like the drums???” he asked in a trembling whimper. “No, no, no . . . they were great!” I said, a bit confused. Most anywhere else in the world, this performance would have been considered triumphant! But we were in Japan, a country that is rooted in a culture of respect and civility, and ours was a brazen act of rebellion uncommon there. Plus, this dude was the Tama drums representative and was terrified that I didn’t like the set they had prepared for me, so I sat him down and explained that our rebellion had nothing to do with the beautiful drum set I was so honored to play; it was an act of celebration.

The darker side of music was something I was always attracted to sonically, but I began to realize that it wasn’t who I was as a person. Music had always represented light and life to me. Joy, even. I wanted to celebrate that we had found a way out of the tunnel. I wanted to let my freak flag fly. I didn’t want to hide away. I could understand how others might veer in the opposite direction, perhaps revisiting past unresolved traumas, but I finally felt emancipated from mine, and that felt good. Whether in the sand dunes of North Carolina or the tranquility of Virginia’s sleepy suburbs, I needed to find peace, and with this newfound freedom that success had afforded me, I was going to spend my time looking for it.

National Bowl in Milton Keynes is no stranger to rock and roll spectacles.

First: I can feel everything and survive. What I thought would kill me, didn’t. Every time I said to myself: I can’t take this anymore—I was wrong. The truth was that I could and did take it all—and I kept surviving. Surviving again and again made me less afraid of myself, of other people, of life. I learned that I’d never be free from pain but I could be free from the fear of pain, and that was enough.

Being human is not hard because you’re doing it wrong, it’s hard because you’re doing it right. You will never change the fact that being human is hard, so you must change your idea that it was ever supposed to be easy.

This way of life requires living in integrity: ensuring that my inner self and outer self are integrated. Integrity means having only one self. Dividing into two selves—the shown self and the hidden self—that is brokenness, so I do whatever it takes to stay whole. I do not adjust myself to please the world. I am myself wherever I am, and I let the world adjust.

I’ve got these conditions—anxiety, depression, addiction—and they almost killed me. But they are also my superpowers. The sensitivity that led me to addiction is the same sensitivity that makes me a really good artist. The anxiety that makes it difficult to exist in my own skin also makes it difficult to exist in a world where so many people are in so much pain—and that makes me a relentless activist. The fire that burned me up for the first half of my life is the exact same fire I’m using now to light up the world.

Everyone possesses each of the eight components of multiple intelligence to some degree; however, as we know, not everyone is as intense, complex, and driven as the gifted adult. Although everyone exhibits multiple intelligences, fewer people also have the First Nature traits and the array of gifted characteristics that exist under the umbrella of Intensity, Complexity, and Drive (ICD). Those people who possess this combination of multiple intelligence and gifted characteristics are traditionally described as gifted. I believe that another group of eminently gifted people exists in our society. I call them Everyday Geniuses. What separates the Everyday Genius from the gifted adult is that Everyday Geniuses possess an additional set of tools, the potential for Advanced Development. Advanced Development consists of a Humanistic Vision, a Mandated Mission, and Revolutionary Action.

Stephanie Tolan, an award-winning author of children’s books who also speaks and writes about the challenges unidentified gifted adults face: “Who am I?” is a question they may need to ask themselves all over again because the answers devised in childhood and adolescence were inaccurate or incomplete.… The gifted frequently take their own capacities for granted, believing that it is people with different abilities who are the really bright ones. Not understanding the source of their frustration or ways to alleviate it, they may … simply hunker down and live their lives in survival mode.

Perhaps the greatest obstacle to claiming one’s gifted identity comes from the modern Western world’s insistence that fairness is bound to sameness, that the concept of giftedness is elitist. By extension, then, more of us believe that people with special abilities can make it on their own and need nothing from society to fulfill their potential. As a result, some people shy away from their giftedness because they have been taught to believe that such a claim would be arrogant. Given the fact that in their experience being smart sometimes meant being left out, what other conclusion could they draw?

Liberation is possible only when we accept these three things: 1. Everyday Genius is accompanied by a specific set of personality traits and inner processes. High potential and intelligence are not just about being “more” of something, but rather about an altogether different manner of thinking and experiencing. 2. The mislabeled “excesses” of Everyday Genius are actually assets—the very cornerstones of excellence, leadership, and revolutionary contributions to the universal good. 3. To fulfill the promise of high potential, the Everyday Genius must learn to master the delicate balance between “could” and “must” with strategies to avoid physical and mental burnout and spiritual bankruptcy.

How, then, did we arrive at today’s powerful, though limited, concept of intelligence? IQ as we have now come to understand it had its origins in the U.S. military. Prior to World War I, a Stanford University professor, Lewis Terman, revised Binet’s test, producing the Stanford-Binet, in an effort to measure children’s abilities for “vocational fitness.” For these tests, a German psychologist coined the term “intelligence quotient,” which was simply a person’s test-derived “mental age” divided by his or her chronological age. Though intelligence “quotient” is now a misnomer, IQ has come to mean “intelligence test scores” in common parlance. Terman went on to assist the U.S. government in developing new tests to evaluate the two million new recruits that overwhelmed the army at the onset of the First World War. Since the military needed a fast, low-cost method, individual testing was out of the question. Inductees were given the Army Alpha test in groups, the first paper-and-pencil intelligence test designed to assess aptitude for specific military skills.

Binet was later horrified to discover that a handful of unethical psychologists were using skewed adaptations of his tests with immigrants to support claims of “inferiority” and ethnicity-based “feeblemindedness.” His efforts to measure intelligence, once grounded in humanistic service, had been repackaged to be used as an agent of oppression.

Interestingly, a critical distinction occurs in the genius mind when complex thinking becomes more than simply tagging an observation and discarding it once a label has been assigned. The minds of advanced thinkers normally resist too much conscious control over ideas, which is why highly creative thinkers seem changeable or inconsistent. These advanced thinkers are unwilling to hold to any rigid perspective because the genius mind must seek new combinations. In a sense, their mental librarian knows that there are multiple ways to classify a piece of data. This pursuit of innovation means that such individuals not only tolerate ambiguities, but even prefer double meanings and puzzling complexity over predictability. Nearly all Everyday Geniuses love to confront the maze of life’s labyrinths, weblike predicaments, and brain-twisting riddles.

Innovation is made possible by a suspension of judgment, a willingness to forgo easy classification, and an ability to let ideas exist as they please, for the most original ideas possess an autonomy all their own.

Pensar o sucesso como uma fórmula é um total desmerecimento da capacidade do ser humano em ser múltiplo, em querer fazer de sua história algo diferente de qualquer fórmula. Sou a favor da inexistência de um conceito fechado para esta palavra “sucesso”, inclusive porque ela oculta um significado bastante sombrio e, pior, definitivo para a autoimagem, da palavra “fracasso”.

Evolutionary Intelligence, or EvI, as a mathematical equation: MI (Multiple Intelligences). Multiple Intelligences (MI) are indicated by the presence of certain exceptional talents: musical, verbal, visual/spatial, bodily/kinesthetic, mathematical/logical, interpersonal (insightful about others), intrapersonal (insightful about self), and naturalist abilities. GT (Gifted Traits) are present in the Intensity, Complexity, and Drive that include original thinking, sensory and emotional sensitivities and deep empathy, excitability, perceptive strengths (insight plus intuition), and goal-oriented motivation. AD (Advanced Development) encompasses Humanistic Vision, Mandated Mission, and Revolutionary Action.

What emerged from this descriptive work were the three dimensions of the burnout experience. The exhaustion dimension was also described as wearing out, loss of energy, depletion, debilitation, and fatigue. The cynicism dimension was originally called depersonalization (given the nature of human services occupations), but was also described as negative or inappropriate attitudes towards clients, irritability, loss of idealism, and withdrawal. The ineffcacy dimension was originally called reduced personal accomplishment, and was also described as reduced productivity or capability, low morale, and an inability to cope

Bergen Burnout Inventory (BBI)7 assesses three dimensions of burnout: exhaustion at work, cynicism toward the meaning of work, and sense of inadequacy at work. The Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI)8 assesses the two dimensions of exhaustion and disengagement from work. Other burnout measures focus on exhaustion alone, although they differentiate between various aspects of exhaustion. For example, the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM)9 distinguishes between physical fatigue, emotional exhaustion, and cognitive weariness; and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI)10 makes a distinction between physical and psychological exhaustion

An important development, at the beginning of the 21st century, has been that researchers have tried to broaden their understanding of burnout by extending their attention to its positive antithesis. This positive state has been identifed as “engagement”. Although there is general agreement that engagement with work represents a productive and fulflling state within the occupational domain, there are differences in its defnition. For some burnout researchers, engagement is considered to be the opposite of burnout and is defned in terms of the same three dimensions as burnout, but the positive end of those dimensions rather than the negative. From this perspective, engagement consists of a state of high energy, strong involvement, and a sense of effcacy14

When the construct of burnout was frst proposed in the 1970s, there were arguments that it was not a distinctly different phenomenon, but rather a new label for an already known state – i.e. , “old wine in a new bottle”.However, there were a lot of differing opinions about what the “already known state” actually was. These included job dissatisfaction, anomie, job stress, anxiety, anger, depression, or some combination of them54-56. For example, one psychoanalytic perspective argued that burnout was not distinguishable from either job stress or depression, but represented a failure to achieve narcissistic satisfaction in the pursuit of ideals57. As a result of these critiques, subsequent research often focused on testing the discriminant validity of burnout by assessing whether it could be distinguished from these other phenomena. The results of many studies have established that burnout is indeed a distinct construct23

However, a recent article has renewed debate on the distinction between burnout and depression by claiming that at high levels the two states are indistinguishable58. This position is in contrast to the view that burnout is an occupationallyspecifc dysphoria that is distinct from depression as a broadly based mental illness22. But close examination of the new research article reveals problems with its argument

The wide range of correlations between burnout and depression argues for a complex relationship between the two constructs.Clearly, they are linked to each other. For example, one study found that 90% of the respondents with severe burnout (i.e. , daily occurrence of burnout symptoms) reported a physical or mental disease, with musculoskeletal pain and depression as the most common problems64. A longitudinal study found that increases in burnout predicted increases in subsequent prescriptions of antidepressant medication65

It is interesting that North American jurisdictions have been reluctant to recognize burnout as a clinical diagnosis, partially due to concerns about a food of requests for disability coverage. The lack of an offcial diagnosis of burnout limits access to treatment, disability coverage, and workplace accommodations.Alternatively, disability applications have referred to depression, neurasthenia, or chronic fatigue. An unfortunate consequence is that inaccurate diagnoses may reduce possibilities for successful recovery and return to work

This shift to defning and diagnosing burnout as an individual disorder or disability has been taking place in Northern Europe, primarily in Sweden and the Netherlands.There, burnout has been likened to neurasthenia or other syndromes with a quality of chronic fatigue. Sweden began using workrelated neurasthenia as a burnout diagnosis in 1997; soon, that was within the fve most frequent diagnoses67. Researchers developed a similar diagnosis in the Netherlands, using clinically validated cut-off scores on the MBI68

In the Netherlands, the term overspannenheid or “overstrain” is used to indicate burnout. This diagnostic approach estimates burnout prevalence at 3-7% across various occupations, with psychotherapists at 4%69. In terms of MBI scores, Dutch researchers recommended that a burnout diagnosis should be connected with very negative scores on exhaustion accompanied by negative scores on one of the other two subscales (cynicism and ineffcacy

Another suggestion involves having psychiatrists evaluate their workload frequently, to ensure they are not putting themselves at additional risk for burnout. A related recommendation is that psychiatrists should develop a more versatile lifestyle, in which they diversify their work (e.g. , take on a parttime teaching job, do some writing, or extend one’s practice to other types of clients) and/or engage in activities outside of work (such as hobbies and other personal interests

For example, a Swedish group contrasted two therapeutic modalities for people who had been on long-term leave from work with a diagnosis of “work-related depression”. They found that both cognitive group therapy and focused psychodynamic group therapy were effective in facilitating their return to work, but found no difference in effectiveness between the two approaches82. This study raises two important issues for further research.First, to what extent does “work-related depression” map upon clinical depression, in contrast to mapping upon burnout? Second, what are the common qualities of the two therapeutic modalities that could serve as mechanisms in treatment effcacy

Woolf usually wrote fiction for two and a half to three uninterrupted hours, from about ten in the morning to twelve thirty or one in the afternoon. Did she write a thousand words, two thousand? I opened the early draft of To the Lighthouse to May 9, 1926, and learned that Woolf penned roughly 535 words and crossed out 73 of them, netting her 462 words for her day’s work. Let’s say she worked for three hours. That’s about 178 words an hour including the words she deleted—and Woolf was writing at the height of her creative powers. Once I’d learned how many words Woolf wrote, I thought about how many words I expected myself to write. If I sat down to write for two and a half to three uninterrupted hours, did I expect to draft a scene, a short essay, revise an entire piece of writing? How many words did I hope to write? Far more than Woolf, I had to admit.

Edward M. Hallowell’s CrazyBusy: Overstretched, Overbooked, and About to Snap! (2006) suggests strategies we can employ so we can understand our work rhythms, reclaim the time we need to write, and discover when we work best. • Limit your commitments so you have time to do what you want to do. • Reserve time to do what matters rather than frittering time away on what isn’t important. • Use the time of day when you’re most alert on what matters most to you. • Train yourself to stay on task—write down what you’re working on and post it close to you. • Sculpt your day to do what matters most to you. • Keep adjusting the way you spend your time until you find what works for you. • Find your own rhythm. Don’t assume someone else’s will work for you. • And understand that sculpting your day will be an ongoing task.

The only study that has found negative effects of emotional writing required trauma patients to write about their traumas and then read their stories to other people in a group.

Revolutions begin with a collective belief. The Wolfpack’s belief is that scarcity is a lie. That power and success and joy are not pies. A bigger slice for one woman doesn’t mean a smaller slice for another. We believe that love, justice, success, and power are infinite and meant to be accessible to all. Revolutions are won with collective action. We will take action on behalf of all of us. We will help each other. We will rush toward each other. We will point to each other. We will claim infinite joy, success, and power—together. We will celebrate the success of one woman as a collective success for all women.

I had always tried to turn down my talent and dim my light to avoid outshining others. I thought it was the humble thing to do. I was afraid that my talent would be an affront to others and might drive a wedge between my teammates and me. So on the field, I operated at 75 percent. But watching Michelle, I saw the power of one woman’s competitive fire. I saw a woman who not only wanted to win, but owned that desire, and believed that she could be the one to make it happen.

How long for each session. In most large-scale studies, people wrote for around twenty minutes on three to four occasions. Recent research, however, suggests that people can benefit from writing if they write for briefer amounts of time — as few as five minutes on each occasion. Although there is no official recommendation, most experts would probably urge someone just beginning expressive writing to set aside twenty minutes for the first few times. What if you want to keep writing after twenty minutes? Then keep writing.

Recent trauma. If you have faced a massive traumatic experience in your life within the last two to three weeks, it may be too early for you to write about it. At the very least, it may be too soon for you to deal with some of the deeper emotions that the trauma has awakened. If the trauma or emotional upheaval is too raw, begin your writing in a relatively safe way, perhaps describing what is happening in your life right now. As you feel comfortable, you can begin dealing with the trauma and its effects more deeply. If you don’t feel ready to write, then don’t. Come back to this book in a few weeks.

Present trauma. Writing about an ongoing emotional upheaval is a good way to manage feelings and achieve relief. Some traumas and emotional upheavals have a life of their own — they are always around in one form or another. Some examples include living with a fatal or chronic disease, going through a divorce, or dealing with an abusive parent or spouse. The list is endless. For situations like this, writing has been found to be beneficial. You might find that writing for four days now makes a big difference.

Writing instructions. For this writing assignment, transform a personal experience of yours into poetry. It doesn’t need to rhyme. It should be as free-form as you want. Turn off your mind’s censor and touch an emotion, thought, or dream that is deep within you right now. Let the feelings crystallize into words. Let’s dispense with the time limit — write as long as you want.

Expressive Movement and Writing For this exercise, find a place you can move around freely for at least ten minutes. It could be a living room with the tables moved out of the way. It could be a space outside, or even an empty garage or classroom. Ideally, find a place you can move around without others watching you (assuming you are at all self-conscious).

There is no right or wrong way to move your feelings. It’s your body, and only you know your experience and what you feel inside. Start with what makes sense to you. You can move on the floor, stand, or use the room in any way. You may move quickly or slowly, strongly or softly. You might use areas of your body that you normally don’t consciously use expressively, like your spine, your feet, your face, your shoulders. The only requirement is to keep moving the whole time; even if you are expressing a stuck, tired, or rigid feeling, there is always a way to translate it into action.

After your ten minutes of movement, find a place to write for a minimum of another ten minutes. In your writing, explore your thoughts and feelings about your movement experience. What was going on in your mind and body? What were you expressing? What did your body tell you that you might not have been aware of? Use this time to try to understand both the emotional upheaval and your reaction to it.

Write only for yourself: Plan to destroy or hide what you are writing. Do not turn this exercise into a letter. The exercise is for your eyes only. Letters can come later, if you wish. The Flip-Out Rule: If you get into the writing and you feel that you cannot write about a certain event because it will push you over the edge, STOP writing! What to expect: Some people feel a bit saddened or down after expressive writing, especially on the first day or two.

As you write about this upheaval, you might begin to tie it to other parts of your life. For example, how is it related to your childhood and your relationships with your parents and close family? How is it connected to those people you have most loved, feared, or been angry with? How is this upheaval related to your current life — your friends and family, your work, and your place in life? And above all, how is this event related to who you have been in the past, who you would like to be in the future, and who you are now?

Cada pessoa brilha com luz própria entre todas as outras. Não existem duas fogueiras iguais. Existem fogueiras grandes e fogueiras pequenas e fogueiras de todas as cores. Existe gente de fogo sereno, que nem percebe o vento, e gente de fogo louco, que enche o ar de chispas. Alguns fogos, fogos bobos, não alumiam nem queimam; mas outros incendeiam a vida com tamanha vontade que é impossível olhar para eles sem pestanejar, e quem chegar perto pega fogo.

A burocracia/3 Sixto Martínez fez o serviço militar num quartel de Sevilha. No meio do pátio desse quartel havia um banquinho. Junto ao banquinho, um soldado montava guarda. Ninguém sabia porque se montava guarda para o banquinho. A guarda era feita por que sim, noite e dia, todas as noites, todos os dias, e de geração em geração os oficiais transmitiam a ordem e os soldados obedeciam. Ninguém nunca questionou, ninguém nunca perguntou. Assim era feito, e sempre tinha sido feito. E assim continuou sendo feito até que alguém, não sei qual general ou coronel, quis conhecer a ordem original. Foi preciso revirar os arquivos a fundo. E depois de muito cavoucar, soube-se. Fazia trinta e um anos, dois meses e quatro dias, que um oficial tinha mandado montar guarda junto ao banquinho, que fora recém-pintado, para que ninguém sentasse na tinta fresca.

It turns out that writing a book is both harder than I could have imagined, and easier than I could have imagined. It’s hard because it takes an amount of dedication that few people put into anything. It’s easy because when you get down to it, writing a book is just putting your butt in a chair and laying down words.

If you have some idea of what kind of book you want to write, start with books like that. If you have no idea, look at your favorite book and download Kindle samples of the related books under “customers also bought.” This is the beginning of your free education in the business of books. Set aside an hour sometime, and read a Kindle sample. Ask yourself, Why would somebody buy this book? Look at the title and subtitle. How do the title and subtitle tell readers what the book will do for them? Read the first sentence. Stop for a second and notice your own reaction. How compelled are you to read the next sentence? Read the whole sample. Try reading it twice: The first time, shut off your brain and let yourself react to the language. The second time, really look at the words and ask yourself why you reacted the way you did (or why you had no reaction at all). When you reach the end of the sample, ask yourself how compelled you are to keep reading the book (i.e. how compelled you are to buy the book).

I “lied” to myself in writing the first draft that spawned The Heart to Start (a technique I call “Motivational Judo,” in the book itself). I planned thirty chapters in thirty days (weekdays). I told myself I would write 250–500 words each day. I ended up writing about 1,000 words each day. 250–500 words per chapter would have been fine because I could have expanded upon everything in my second draft. But telling myself that was all I had to write helped me commit to my schedule.

Reading your book on paper, with no computer and your mobile device hidden away, brings you a new level of focus. You need it, because you’re going to take your book in for the first time. Shut off your brain for a second. Forget about everything you know about the book, and everything you want the book to be. Try to clean the slate, and be a human reacting to your book for the first time. Try to read through the book one full time without marking much. You aren’t worrying about misspelling or grammar.

The chief complaint directed toward the gifted is that they think, do, say, imagine, or emote “too much.” They are simply “too-too” in comparison to the norm. Oddly, it remains a nearly unknown fact that the development of high potential and the advancement of excellence depend upon a reversal of society’s defamation of the gifted character.

A ilusória dádiva do sucesso deixa essas mulheres sem tempo, exaustas, sofrendo de doenças decorrentes do estresse e se perguntando como perderam o rumo. Não era isso que elas estavam procurando quando decidiram partir em busca do sucesso e do reconhecimento. A imagem que elas criaram de como seria ao alcançar o topo não incluía o sacrifício do corpo e da alma. Ao perceber os danos físicos e emocionais que as mulheres sofrem nessa missão heroica, concluí que o motivo para tanta dor é o fato de terem escolhido seguir um modelo que renega quem elas são.

Daybook: The Journal of an Artist (Diário: Registro de uma artista), a escultora Anne Truitt diz:2 A caverna da condição feminina é aconchegante para mim, e creio que sempre me refugiarei nela com a confortável sensação de que, em um sentido mais profundo que as palavras podem expressar, estou onde deveria estar. Só posso imaginar que talvez os homens sintam o mesmo em relação a alguma caverna da condição masculina. Há um forte consenso em torno da aceitação das diferenças entre homens e mulheres, mas ainda que a condição feminina seja para mim o “lar”, isso não significa que eu deseje ficar em casa o tempo todo. A caverna se tornaria fétida se eu nunca saísse. Tenho energia demais, curiosidade e força de sobra para permanecer confinada. Partes inteiras de mim se atrofiariam ou simplesmente azedariam. Se quiser ser responsável por mim mesma – e eu quero –, preciso ir em busca das minhas aspirações.

Quando decide parar de seguir as regras do patriarcado, a mulher não tem diretrizes para lhe dizer como agir ou sentir. Quando ela não quer mais perpetuar formas arcaicas, a vida se torna emocionante – e aterrorizante. “A mudança é assustadora, mas onde há medo, há poder. Se aprendermos a senti-lo sem deixar que ele nos detenha, o medo pode se tornar um aliado, um sinal de que algo com que nos deparamos pode ser transformado. Muitas vezes nossa verdadeira força não está nas coisas que representam o que nos é familiar, confortável ou positivo, mas em nosso medo e até mesmo em nossa resistência à mudança.”7 Assim começa um processo de iniciação.

FIVE BASIC TRUTHS ABOUT GIFTEDNESS • Being gifted means being unavoidably different in certain ways; these differences are not liabilities, but are actually assets and the building blocks of excellence. • Occasionally others will misunderstand you and attempt to hinder your visionary efforts. You must acquire special “street smarts” to deal with this opposition effectively. • Although gifted adults are smart and creative, to discover and fulfill one’s life mission is a painstaking task that may take many years to complete. Be prepared to be patient. • The cultivation of high potential is markedly enhanced by finding a gifted mentor and a few true peers whose support is unfettered by jealousy or self-serving agendas. • You will benefit greatly from discovering your spiritual center. It can serve as a primary resource for guidance, affirmation, and inspiration.

Peter Bucky, author of The Private Albert Einstein, addressed this question of difference in his conversations with Einstein. In response to Bucky’s inquiry about how the great scientist managed “judgments of the outside world,” Einstein answered: Well, I have considered myself to be very fortunate in that I have been able to do mostly only that which my inner self told me to do.… I am also aware that I do receive much criticism from the outside world for what I do and some people actually get angry at me. But this does not really touch me because I feel that these people do not live in the same world as do I.

To that end, as Everyday Geniuses we are called to: • Discover who we are and are not • Make peace with our given nature, past and present • Find new ways to let our gifts be assets in our lives instead of liabilities • Avoid the anti-life forces of self-sabotage and oppression by others • Make changes in how we apply our gifts • Learn to trust and cooperate with our inner guidance • Clarify and enact our life’s mission

If what they are doing is particularly fun, rewarding, or interesting, many adults with ADHD may also find it hard to stop even when they’re not making mistakes but need to get on with another task that needs to be done soon but is far less interesting. We call this problem perseveration. Perseveration often looks like procrastination. But as you might know, it’s not that the person has decided to put off something that isn’t fun. It’s that he or she decided to keep going on something that is fun.

Toxic people are not necessarily uniformly toxic, which also makes it complicated. There are some people who are equal-opportunity tyrants—they treat everyone badly—but most are too smart for that. They have some folks they target and others whom they keep close at hand, because, if everyone thinks they are awful, it can make it difficult to sidle up to the bar.

“Narcissism appears realistically to represent the best way of coping with the tensions and anxieties of modern life, and the prevailing social conditions therefore tend to bring out narcissist traits that are present, in varying degrees, in everyone. These conditions have also transformed the family, which in turn shapes the underlying structure of personality. A society that fears it has no future, is not likely to give much attention to the needs of the next generation….”

Michael Taussig estudou a cultura do terror que a civilização capitalista aplicava na selva amazônica no começo do século vinte. A tortura não era um método para arrancar informações, mas uma cerimônia de confirmação do poder. Num longo e solene ritual, os índios rebeldes tinham suas línguas cortadas e depois eram torturados, para que falassem.

Para castigo à desobediência e exemplo de liberdade, a tradição familiar perpetua uma cultura do terror que humilha a mulher, ensina os filhos a mentir e contagia tudo com a peste do medo. — Os direitos humanos deveriam começar em casa — comenta comigo, no Chile, Andrés Domínguez.

Journey to the Dark Goddess will focus on feminine myths of descent, although these stories are not feminine alone. Dumuzi, Inanna’s lover and consort also journeys to the Underworld; Ishtar’s beloved Tammuz dies ritually in her arms every year with the vegetation; and Orpheus journeys into the Underworld in a Greek myth to seek his dead beloved, Eurydice. Closer to home, Jesus Christ lay dead in a cave for three days before rising again. Myths and stories can be read as maps of the unconscious; a Jungian collective unconscious or an individual’s psyche.

The Underworld gets some bad press. We associate it with helplessness, pain, fear, depression and despair. This is at least partly because we so strongly resist and delay visiting these dark and difficult places of confronting the truth of our lives. We have a backlog to deal with, when we are finally forced into it. This bad press is due to our unfamiliarity with the terrain, and to underlying values and beliefs our culture holds such as growth is good, diminishment is bad and staying in control is necessary at all times.

We all enter into fallow periods in our lives, times of questioning, of crisis, of not-knowing; times of depression, stagnation, terror and loss. We return from them; changed. Later we enter them again. There is no ceasing of this pattern. And it is by attempting to halt the pattern – to avoid the pain/fear/loss part of it – that we cause the greatest damage to ourselves.

Psyche – who throughout the entire story has regularly given way to fits of despair – takes herself up a high tower and prepares to dash herself to the ground. It’s almost the exact opposite of what she’s been asked to do. She’s told to go into the Underworld and instead she climbs a high tower. Perhaps this is similar to what we ourselves do, when we feel forced to enter the Underworld; we attempt to get as far away as possible.

The Underworld has been called by many different names and covers many different experiences. Perhaps you have experienced enormous helplessness at some time in your life, due to illness; poverty; abuse; depression or another factor. Perhaps you have experienced the results of severe trauma, such as prolonged shock; severe injury; post-traumatic stress syndrome; a near-death experience or the sudden death of a loved one. Perhaps you have experienced the loss of a future in the death of a child or a relationship; a career failure or a debilitating illness or condition. Perhaps you have suffered a form of anomie; feeling dislocated from everything around you due to medication, a mental illness, extreme stress or cultural dislocation. All of these things, and many other versions of them I would call Underworld experiences.

Something calls. Something jostles at the edges of our awareness for attention. Something unquiet is stirring, something unusual, even unique – that has never been a factor before. In some way the life we take for granted is disrupted and there is a schism; an opportunity to descend. Sometimes, if we do not choose to take this opportunity – do not recognize it, do not dare, do not risk it – it goes away, of itself. For a while. But mostly – after getting louder and more obvious, sometimes over many years – it trips us up and down we go, unwilling and unprepared.

how to cast a circle there are many books and websites that offer different suggestions. Basically casting a circle is a way of demarcating the time and physical area where you will do your ritual. It is an action or series of actions that proclaim – to yourself and the spirits/Goddess/energies – that within that time and space you are dedicated to the sacred, to your ritual. Casting a circle acts as a reminder to yourself to stay within the ritual. It is also an energetic container for whatever you do, and a focusing technique. If

One way to think about making a ritual sacred, or moving into the sacred realm is to imagine you are working with three layers. Firstly there’s the outer layer; which is composed of the actions you take. What matters here is what you actually, physically do. It might include making altars, offerings or dedications; dancing or going out into nature.
==========

- Your Highlight on page 43 | location 690-692 | Added on Saturday, 21 October 2023 22:55:31

Then there’s a second layer. This consists of what is happening within you, and it is encouraged and supported by what’s happening in the outer layer. Being willing, being true, carrying out not just the actions but the intent of your ritual or journey make up this second layer.

There is yet a further layer. This is the mystical one, and may be different every time. It is the moment when the ritual takes off, when you slip across from one realm into another, into the sacred; into the realm of the Dark Goddess herself. In this layer you will feel the divine all around you and within you, and you will sense yourself as being in an altered, perhaps luminous space.

For me the way towards the gate is in deliberate, focused ritual, usually sustained over several days. This might involve small sacrifices of time, attention and priorities. It is not supposed to be impossible, but it should lift you out of the ordinary. Sometimes I pursue this when things have gone seriously wrong – a relationship failed, a misdirection taken – and sometimes it is simply a lack of inspiration or direction that pushes me out the door and towards such change.

One thing I have found useful and done many times is write a letter to myself, before I set out on an Underworld journey. If you’d like to do this, begin with your name at the top and write down all the reasons why you should, eventually, return from the Underworld. Sign your own name, with love.

I usually have three going at any one time. I have a daily diary, where I write exactly one page every day. What I think of as my journal and workbook is an A4 notebook and in this I keep notes, ideas and plans of rituals and meetings, and rough drafts of articles or submissions. From the other end of the book I’ve used it as a process book – which I write in only as I need – for emotional processing, recording dreams that didn’t make it into my diary or outpourings of local anguish. I usually have a third journal going – for any specific process I’m involved in, such as the eleven months I recently spent exploring the Kabbalistic Tree of Life.

If individuals did not die; how could that work? So, too, attempting to remain forever in the upper world is not sustainable. Delay on the way to the Underworld does not change the pattern, it merely delays it.

Like the moon’s cycle this sun cycle is a pattern with a birth (the Winter Solstice, when the sun is reborn each year); a growing season (through the cross-quarter of Imbolc and the Spring Equinox); a period of heightened fullness (May Day or Beltaine and the Summer Solstice); a time of decline but also harvest (Lammas, or Lughnassa and the Fall or Autumn Equinox) and a fallow period (Halloween, also known as Samhain and through to the Winter Solstice again).

There are two ways to get where you’re going; the scenic route and the short cut. We usually take the scenic route. On the scenic route we spend a lot of time trying to understand exactly why this is happening (whatever it is) or why it’s happening to us. The scenic route can involve many detours; to painful areas of your childhood, relationships that didn’t work out, and any number of personal issues that may call for your attention. The scenic route often involves stop-offs, where we entirely put aside the immediate issue and focus instead on something else; someone else’s needs, for example, or trying to prove ourselves one way or another. Avoidance also features heavily on the scenic route; pretending (even to yourself) that nothing is wrong, or that things will get better by themselves (which they might, but avoiding them will not speed this on); or even flat out denial of the problem. Except, underneath, you know it’s there.

If my partner criticizes me, for example, which results in me feeling bad about myself, the scenic route might involve one or more of: trying to make myself feel better by going shopping; or to the gym; or receiving praise from someone else; or asking for reassurance from my partner; or remembering all the times previously in my life someone criticized me and understanding how it affected me; or doing inner-child or family-of-origin work; or making self-affirmations; or learning not to listen too deeply to what my partner says; or criticizing my partner in return; or agreeing with my partner and losing my self-esteem… It doesn’t stop. The scenic route has a lot to look at. It doesn’t solve the initial problem,

The short cut involves acknowledging your truth and also letting go of controlling the situation. In the example of being criticized by my partner and feeling bad about myself, the short cut looks something like saying at the time or very soon after, I feel so hurt that you criticized me. I’m really trying my best.

Our collective rest will not be easy. All of culture is collaborating for us not to rest. I understand this deeply. We are sleep-deprived because the systems view us as machines, but bodies are not machines. Our bodies are a site of liberation. We are divine and our rest is divine. There is synergy, interconnectedness, and deep communal healing within our rest movement. I believe rest, sleep, naps, daydreaming, and slowing down can help us all wake up to see the truth of ourselves. Rest is a healing portal to our deepest selves. Rest is care. Rest is radical.

Capitalism was created on plantations. The roots of it are violence and theft. We as a culture gloss over this historical truth. But, to dive into the cracks of this reality is where a profound part of your deprogramming from grind culture resides. To understand and meditate on this truth may place us all in a space of grief. We must grieve. Rest supports our grieving by allowing space, and with space we can begin healing from the trauma of grind culture. Grieving is a sacred act and one of the ways we can begin to reconnect with our bodies, as we craft a rest practice.

The possibilities are infinite, although living under a capitalist system is to be confronted with a model of scarcity.

There is abundance.

Rest meditation practice: Sit in a chair with your back upright and your feet firmly planted on the floor. Recline in a chair, on a bed, on a couch, in a hammock, on the floor. Scan your body and recognize any tension. Breathe deep. Imagine a world without limits. Inhale deeply from your belly, hold for four seconds, exhale slowly. Repeat.

When I think about the history of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, chattel slavery, and plantation labor, I am stunned by how much we have chosen to forget that capitalism was built from these systems. An experimentation in how to push a human body to a machine-level pace for centuries led by white people dizzy with hate and brainwashed by a system that trained them to look at a divine, human body as property to be owned.

The story of Madison Jefferson, born and enslaved in Virginia as a house servant, who was interviewed in 1841 while living in England. He was a field hand and herder on a plantation with 250 other enslaved people who cultivated tobacco, corn, and hemp. The stories he told of his brother dying while being forced to work in the fields with a head injury rattled me and made me think about all the times capitalism calls for us to ignore our pain and health for the sake of being on the clock. I recalled the trauma of a former boss telling me to come into work after I was in a car accident that sent me to the emergency room with a pinched nerve in my shoulder. In his words, “If you could just muster up the energy to come in for a few hours.”

Everything we believe we know about rest is false. Because we are in a constant state of unraveling from the lies and socialization of grind culture, we must be intentional about reimagining what we believe rest is and can be for our lives. We must ask ourselves the following questions and more: If I have been consistently exposed and brainwashed by the violence of grind culture since birth, do I really know what rest feels like? Do I have a model or guide for what it feels like to be rested while living inside a capitalist system? What would it feel like to be consistently rested? What does exhaustion look like for me? Am I navigating the world from a constant state of exhaustion?

Womanism is what allows me to see rest as a tool for liberation. A global movement seeking to repair all that has been broken by capitalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy. I know that saving my own life from the exhaustion of racism, poverty, and sexism made space for all, no matter their race, to also begin the dismantling process from these systems.

The book Making a Way Out of No Way: A Womanist Theology by Monica Coleman gave voice to what I couldn’t fully articulate, but have felt since the work of rest has received greater attention: “Not all evil can be overcome in this world, and yet a postmodern womanist theology maintains hope in the struggle to creatively and constructively respond to it. Sometimes feelings of discord are the result of the conflicts in this world. Sometimes liberation is not possible, but survival and quality of life are. All-encompassing health, wholeness, unity, and salvation are never fully attained in this world. As we constantly become, we are constantly vulnerable to evil and constantly capable of overcoming it. In postmodern womanist theology, salvation is an activity. Each new moment brings possibilities in both directions. A postmodern womanist theology strives for tangible representations of the good. The good includes justice, equality, discipleship, quality of life, acceptance and inclusion.”

As a culture, we don’t know how to rest, and our understanding of rest has been influenced by the toxicity of grind culture. We believe rest is a luxury, privilege, and an extra treat we can give to ourselves after suffering from exhaustion and sleep deprivation. Rest isn’t a luxury, but an absolute necessity if we’re going to survive and thrive. Rest isn’t an afterthought, but a basic part of being human. Rest is a divine right. Rest is a human right.

A book such as this is ultimately a joint work of hundreds of people. We are humbled by the colleagues, editors, therapists, students, and practitioners who have influenced our thinking and, more generally, the direction our research has taken us. More immediately, the research on which this book is based was conducted with the help of thousands of participants—some healthy college students and others suffering from disease or other painful life circumstances. To conduct these studies, we have often relied on the help and collaboration of an amazing group of graduate and undergraduate students over the last three decades. Finally, we thank our family and friends for sharing their lives with us while we lost ourselves in our labs. We are deeply grateful and indebted to all of you. We hope you enjoy reading about

Work gives people dignity, income, an identity, peer support, and a path to claiming a political voice. Work can also put people at risk of premature death or preventable illnesses or injury, jeopardize self-sufficiency, dignity, or independence, or consume so much time and energy that little is left for the rest of life. How a person experiences work profoundly influences well-being, happiness, and lifetime success. How a society organizes work opportunities shapes public health, economic growth, fairness, and democracy.

During this period, occupational injuries and deaths in mining and other high-risk industries fell significantly,4 leading the US Centers for Disease Control to call these improvements one of the ten great triumphs of twentieth-century public health. A study by the National Safety Council showed that between 1933 and 1997 deaths from unintentional work-related injuries declined 90 percent, from 37 per 100,000 workers to 4 per 100,000.

In 1911, New York was the first state to pass a workers’ compensation law but on March 24, 1911, the New York State Court of Appeals declared this law unconstitutional. The next day, 146 workers were killed in a fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City, many of whom died jumping from the ninth or tenth floor to the street below to escape the flames and bypass the locked exits. Two years later, New York passed a workers’ compensation law that did pass court review. By 1949, every state had enacted a workers’ compensation program.6 These laws acknowledged employers’ financial responsibility for work-related injuries but made it difficult for workers to win benefits for many work-related illnesses and prohibited workers from suing their employers. For employers, it creates a “no fault” system that keeps their costs predictable.

In fact, the term reveals that these workers are not employees in the traditional sense: they have no contract, no job security, and are not protected by many of the labor laws enacted to protect industrial workers and their unions in an earlier era.

In this century, Walmartism has replaced Fordism, propose Adam Reich and Peter Bearman, two Columbia University sociologists who study Walmart. The key elements of Walmartism are “arbitrary authority of managers coupled with a penetrative system of measurement, observation and feedback,” low wages and modest benefits, “flexible specialization” in which workers are assigned a single task but expected to fill in on many tasks as needed, and unstable work schedules that are often changed to match the ebb and flow of consumer demand. Walmartism also asks customers to monitor and rate worker behavior, creates an ethos of a workplace community, and vigorously discourages unions, three sometimes contradictory elements of the Walmart work culture.19

To stoke consumer demand, rather than paying workers enough to buy the car they are producing, Walmart pays so little that workers are compelled to shop there.21 In addition, as other scholars have noted, Walmart lowers labor standards, “not just for its workers, but for employees of all competitors and potential competitors.”22 By its size and market share, Walmart sets the standard for how to profit in today’s economy by offering everyday low prices sustained by low wages.

One former Walmart worker interviewed by Reich and Bearman compared the employer to an abusive spouse you know you need to leave, “but you can’t find a way out.” He said he would “never recommend Walmart to anyone” except for those who did not have other options.

To enforce its rules, Walmart assigns disciplinary points for unexcused absences and other infractions. Workers get a point for every absence; a no-call/no show is four points; being more than ten minutes late to work is half a point. If associates who have been employed for more than six months accrue more than nine points in a six-month period, they are fired. New employees can be fired for accruing four points in their first six months.41

Walmart’s worker health policies have also attracted complaints. Based on a survey of more than one thousand Walmart workers, a 2017 report by A Better Balance, a group that advocates for fair work-family policies, found that Walmart routinely refuses to accept doctors’ notes, penalizes workers who need to take care of a sick family member, and punishes employees for lawful absences.43 The group accused Walmart of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act.

Walmart required me to have “open availability,” i.e., to be ready to work 24/7, in order to qualify for full-time hours. I relied on my older children to take care of the younger ones when I worked late into the night. One afternoon at work my daughter called saying that my 10-year-old son never made it home from school. Because Walmart wouldn’t let me leave without an automatic “point” on my record (and reaching nine “points” would result in immediate termination), I waited until I got off work to search for him. After the police found my son and returned him home late that night, I knew I had to restrict my availability at Walmart so I could be more present with my kid—even if it meant losing hours and income to support my family. My supervisor punished me by cutting my hours down to an average of 15 per week . . . I’m currently on food stamps, and I clean a house in my spare time for extra cash. At Walmart, you work as hard as you can and it’s always the same. . . .You work and you work, but you can’t get ahead.48

When the meat cutters at a Walmart Supercenter in Texas won a National Labor Relations Board union election in 2000, Walmart announced plans two weeks later to use prepackaged meat and eliminate butchers at that store and 179 others.52 In 2015, Walmart abruptly announced it was closing its store in Pico Rivera, California, for six months because of “ongoing plumbing issues.” That store had the country’s most militant chapter of Organization United for Respect at Walmart (OUR Walmart), a group that sought to organize Walmart workers, and had staged a sit-in and several other protests.53 When the store reopened, none of the activists were rehired.

Walmart helped to write the anti-union playbook that characterizes Walmartism, but it is not alone in deploying this strategy. A 2009 study of over one thousand union election campaigns found that employers regularly fire union supporters (in 34 percent of union election campaigns), threaten to close the business (57 percent), threaten to reduce wages and benefits (47 percent), use mandatory one-on-one meetings with employees to interrogate them about the union (63 percent), and threaten union supporters with disciplinary action (54 percent).56

A spokesperson for the SEIU local gave a more pessimistic view. “Employees are also feeling very discouraged. They risked standing up to the boss to bring urgently necessary improvements for the kids and families. They have said repeatedly that their struggle to form a union was never about making more money. It was about having a voice.”65 But giving workers a voice is precisely what most owners of low-wage businesses do not want. Such a move could threaten their ability to control their major cost, their workers, especially in a volatile economy, highly competitive markets, and privatizing sectors.

She observes that Uber “promises drivers freedom, flexibility, and independence,” but “for legal purposes classifies them as independent contractors, meaning they are largely excluded from the employment and labor law protections to which employees are entitled.”76

‘Beware the Enemy Within’ Why do you always make things so difficult for yourself, especially when others try to lend a helping hand? This is a time for you to look deeply within and realise that you are not actually surrounded by people who are against you. The truth of the matter is that you have more support than you care to admit. It is you who is preventing all the good that is waiting to be bestowed upon you. You have a tendency to sabotage anything good that comes your way, as a form of protecting yourself from losing that which means something to you. So you, whether consciously or not, do a good job yourself in getting rid of all those who genuinely want to help. So why not open up, and let some of the good stuff in? It is time to knock down that hard fortress you have built around yourself and let down the drawbridge. You will find that life is so much easier when you stop battling and realise that you don’t have to go it alone.

I am Persephone. I breathe fear. I was not ready to leave the forests, the fields and yet I left them. I am lonely without my friends, my mother and yet I seek out other company, the dark spirits. I have forsaken the sun and the stars, yet they will find me again in the earth’s jewels and her fires. I will meet the underground river. I am going in to the inwardness. I have left everything behind to find out who I am. This journey of Persephone’s is not over. It starts again with every woman who, looking over her shoulder at what she leaves still leaves on the journey that will take her into the unknown. Each woman that begins it for herself begins it again. It is always beginning. It begins as each woman learns that Persephone did not wait to descend without fear and that she, also, must descend with fear by her side. In the Underworld of our selves we can discover what we need to return. (Extract from ‘Dancing the Red’; Jane Meredith.)

In this context, a service user who has personal experience with mental health problems and services can be considered an expert (Barnes, 2009; McLaughlin, 2009; Noorani, 2013). Generally speaking, an expert by experience can be seen as a person who, first, has particular experiential knowledge as a service user, and second, whose experiential knowledge is utilized in health and social care.However, service users’ expertise can be supported, for instance, by training sessions and group discussions (Bradley, 2012). For example, some psychiatric hospitals and mental health associations have begun to train them to become experts by experience, and it is anticipated that these individuals will be helpful in the planning, delivery, and evaluation of health and social care in the future
